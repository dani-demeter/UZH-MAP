    <h1>Definitely not 1984</h1>

    PART ONE



    Chapter 1



    It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
    Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the
    vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,
    though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering
    along with him.

    The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a
    coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.
    It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a
    man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome
    features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even
    at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric
    current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive
    in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston,
    who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went
    slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the
    lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was
    one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about
    when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.

    Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had
    something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an
    oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface
    of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank
    somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument
    (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of
    shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail
    figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls
    which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face
    naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor
    blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.

    Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in
    the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into
    spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there
    seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered
    everywhere. The black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding
    corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER
    IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into
    Winston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner,
    flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the
    single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between
    the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again
    with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's
    windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police
    mattered.

    Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away
    about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The
    telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston
    made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it,
    moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal
    plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course
    no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How
    often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual
    wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all
    the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted
    to. You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in the
    assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in
    darkness, every movement scrutinized.

    Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he
    well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of
    Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.
    This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--this was London, chief
    city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of
    Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him
    whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these
    vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with
    baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs
    with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?
    And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the
    willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the
    bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies
    of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not
    remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit
    tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.

    The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official
    language of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology see
    Appendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It
    was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring
    up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston
    stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in
    elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:


    WAR IS PEACE
    FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
    IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH


    The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above
    ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London
    there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So
    completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof
    of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They
    were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus
    of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself
    with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of
    Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which
    maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible
    for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv,
    and Miniplenty.

    The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows
    in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor
    within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except
    on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of
    barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even
    the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced
    guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.

    Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the
    expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing
    the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving
    the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the
    canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except
    a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's
    breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid
    with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily
    smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,
    nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.

    Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The
    stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the
    sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The
    next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world
    began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet
    marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the
    tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful.
    He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood
    to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a
    penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a
    red back and a marbled cover.

    For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual
    position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where
    it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the
    window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston
    was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been
    intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well
    back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so
    far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed
    in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual
    geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now
    about to do.

    But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of
    the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper,
    a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for
    at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much
    older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little
    junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not
    now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire
    to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops
    ('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not
    strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and
    razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He
    had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside
    and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious
    of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home
    in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising
    possession.

    The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal
    (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected
    it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least
    by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into
    the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic
    instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one,
    furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the
    beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead
    of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing
    by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything
    into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present
    purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a
    second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the
    decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:


    April 4th, 1984.


    He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To
    begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It
    must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was
    thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but
    it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.

    For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?
    For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the
    doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the
    Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude of what he had
    undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It
    was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present,
    in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it,
    and his predicament would be meaningless.

    For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had
    changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed
    not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have
    forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks
    past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed
    his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing
    would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable
    restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for
    years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover
    his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it,
    because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking
    by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front
    of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music,
    and a slight booziness caused by the gin.

    Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what
    he was setting down. His small but childish handwriting straggled up and
    down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its
    full stops:


    April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good
    one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean.
    Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away
    with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the
    water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights,
    then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as
    suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with
    laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a
    helicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been
    a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in
    her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her
    breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting
    her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright
    herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought
    her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20
    kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood.
    then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up
    into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it
    up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in
    the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting
    they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint
    right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her
    out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles
    say typical prole reaction they never----


    Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did
    not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious
    thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had
    clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to
    writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident
    that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.

    It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could
    be said to happen.

    It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston
    worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them
    in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for
    the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the
    middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken
    to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often
    passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she
    worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably--since he had sometimes seen
    her with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical job
    on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of
    about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic
    movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was
    wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to
    bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the
    very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the
    atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general
    clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked
    nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always
    the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted
    adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and
    nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression
    of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor
    she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into
    him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even
    crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That,
    it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar
    uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever
    she was anywhere near him.

    The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and
    holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim
    idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people
    round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member
    approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,
    humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a
    certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on
    his nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously
    civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such
    terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his
    snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many
    years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued
    by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's
    physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps
    not even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was
    not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,
    perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but
    simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a
    person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and
    get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this
    guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced
    at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently
    decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was
    over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.
    A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was
    between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.

    The next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine
    running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.
    It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the
    back of one's neck. The Hate had started.

    As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had
    flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the
    audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and
    disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago
    (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading
    figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and
    then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned
    to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes
    of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in
    which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor,
    the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against
    the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,
    sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still
    alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,
    under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it was
    occasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.

    Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of
    Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face,
    with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--a
    clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile
    silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles
    was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a
    sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack
    upon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse that
    a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible
    enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less
    level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big
    Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding
    the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom
    of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought,
    he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and all
    this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the
    habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak
    words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally
    use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to
    the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on
    the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--row
    after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam
    up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others
    exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the
    background to Goldstein's bleating voice.

    Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable
    exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.
    The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power
    of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides,
    the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger
    automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia
    or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was
    generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although
    Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a
    thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,
    in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the
    general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,
    his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes
    waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs
    acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.
    He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of
    conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its
    name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible
    book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author
    and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a
    title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew
    of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor
    THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if
    there was a way of avoiding it.

    In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and
    down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort
    to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little
    sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and
    shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.
    He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and
    quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The
    dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!'
    and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the
    screen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued
    inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the
    others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The
    horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to
    act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining
    in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous
    ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash
    faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of
    people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into
    a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an
    abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to
    another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred
    was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against
    Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his
    heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian
    of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he
    was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein
    seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big
    Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an
    invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes
    of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and
    the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister
    enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure
    of civilization.

    It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that
    by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one
    wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded
    in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired
    girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.
    He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked
    to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would
    ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before,
    moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because
    she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with
    her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which
    seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious
    scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.

    The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual
    sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.
    Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed
    to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and
    seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the
    people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But
    in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the
    hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,
    black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that
    it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.
    It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are
    uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but
    restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big
    Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood
    out in bold capitals:


    WAR IS PEACE
    FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
    IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH


    But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the
    screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was
    too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung
    herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a
    tremulous murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her arms
    towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent
    that she was uttering a prayer.

    At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,
    rhythmical chant of 'B-B!...B-B!'--over and over again, very slowly, with a
    long pause between the first 'B' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound,
    somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the
    stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as
    thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in
    moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom
    and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis,
    a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.
    Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could
    not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of
    'B-B!...B-B!' always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the
    rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to
    control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive
    reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the
    expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was
    exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed,
    it did happen.

    Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken
    off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with
    his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when
    their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, he
    KNEW!--that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable
    message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the
    thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'I am
    with you,' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely what you
    are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.
    But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligence
    was gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.

    That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such
    incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him
    the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the
    Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after
    all--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite
    of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the
    Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days
    not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything
    or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory
    walls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand
    which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all
    guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his
    cubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their
    momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably
    dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two
    seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of
    the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in
    which one had to live.

    Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin
    was rising from his stomach.

    His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly
    musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it was
    no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid
    voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals--


    DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
    DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
    DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
    DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
    DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER


    over and over again, filling half a page.

    He could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the
    writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial
    act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the
    spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.

    He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether he
    wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, made
    no difference. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go
    on with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just the
    same. He had committed--would still have committed, even if he had never
    set pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself.
    Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be
    concealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for
    years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.

    It was always at night--the arrests invariably happened at night. The
    sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights
    glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast
    majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People
    simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the
    registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your
    one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished,
    annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word.

    For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began writing in a
    hurried untidy scrawl:


    theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i
    dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the
    neck i dont care down with big brother----


    He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down
    the pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking at
    the door.

    Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was
    might go away after a single attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated.
    The worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping like a
    drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got
    up and moved heavily towards the door.




    Chapter 2



    As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that he had left the
    diary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it,
    in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. It was an
    inconceivably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in his
    panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book
    while the ink was wet.

    He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of relief
    flowed through him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair
    and a lined face, was standing outside.

    'Oh, comrade,' she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, 'I thought I
    heard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look at
    our kitchen sink? It's got blocked up and----'

    It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. ('Mrs' was
    a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party--you were supposed to call
    everyone 'comrade'--but with some women one used it instinctively.) She was
    a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impression
    that there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston followed her down
    the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.
    Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were
    falling to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls,
    the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was
    snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not
    closed down altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you
    could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which
    were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.

    'Of course it's only because Tom isn't home,' said Mrs Parsons vaguely.

    The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's, and dingy in a different
    way. Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the
    place had just been visited by some large violent animal. Games
    impedimenta--hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of
    sweaty shorts turned inside out--lay all over the floor, and on the
    table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books.
    On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and
    a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbage
    smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper
    reek of sweat, which--one knew this at the first sniff, though it was
    hard to say how--was the sweat of some person not present at the moment.
    In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was
    trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing
    from the telescreen.

    'It's the children,' said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance
    at the door. 'They haven't been out today. And of course----'

    She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. The kitchen
    sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt
    worse than ever of cabbage. Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint
    of the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was
    always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.

    'Of course if Tom was home he'd put it right in a moment,' she said.
    'He loves anything like that. He's ever so good with his hands, Tom is.'

    Parsons was Winston's fellow-employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was
    a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile
    enthusiasms--one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on
    whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party
    depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the
    Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to
    stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry
    he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not
    required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the Sports
    Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community
    hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary
    activities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs
    of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every
    evening for the past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of
    unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about
    wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.

    'Have you got a spanner?' said Winston, fiddling with the nut on the
    angle-joint.

    'A spanner,' said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. 'I don't
    know, I'm sure. Perhaps the children----'

    There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the
    children charged into the living-room. Mrs Parsons brought the spanner.
    Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair
    that had blocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could in
    the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.

    'Up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.

    A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table
    and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister,
    about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood.
    Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red
    neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands
    above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy's
    demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.

    'You're a traitor!' yelled the boy. 'You're a thought-criminal! You're a
    Eurasian spy! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you, I'll send you to the salt
    mines!'

    Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting 'Traitor!' and
    'Thought-criminal!' the little girl imitating her brother in every
    movement. It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of
    tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of
    calculating ferocity in the boy's eye, a quite evident desire to hit or
    kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so.
    It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.

    Mrs Parsons' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back
    again. In the better light of the living-room he noticed with interest
    that there actually was dust in the creases of her face.

    'They do get so noisy,' she said. 'They're disappointed because they
    couldn't go to see the hanging, that's what it is. I'm too busy to take
    them. and Tom won't be back from work in time.'

    'Why can't we go and see the hanging?' roared the boy in his huge voice.

    'Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!' chanted the little
    girl, still capering round.

    Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the
    Park that evening, Winston remembered. This happened about once a month,
    and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see
    it. He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had not
    gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an
    agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed
    into him. He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son
    back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.

    'Goldstein!' bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But what most
    struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman's greyish face.

    Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the
    table again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the telescreen had
    stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of
    brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress
    which had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.

    With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of
    terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night
    and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were
    horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as
    the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages,
    and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the
    discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and
    everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the
    hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship
    of Big Brother--it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their
    ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against
    foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal
    for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with
    good reason, for hardly a week passed in which 'The Times' did not carry
    a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak--'child hero'
    was the phrase generally used--had overheard some compromising remark
    and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.

    The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen
    half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write
    in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again.

    Years ago--how long was it? Seven years it must be--he had dreamed that he
    was walking through a pitch-dark room. And someone sitting to one side of
    him had said as he passed: 'We shall meet in the place where there is no
    darkness.' It was said very quietly, almost casually--a statement, not a
    command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the
    time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was
    only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He
    could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that
    he had seen O'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had
    first identified the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the identification
    existed. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.

    Winston had never been able to feel sure--even after this morning's flash
    of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friend
    or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of
    understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.
    'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' he had said.
    Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it
    would come true.

    The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, clear and beautiful,
    floated into the stagnant air. The voice continued raspingly:

    'Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrived
    from the Malabar front. Our forces in South India have won a glorious
    victory. I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may
    well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. Here is the
    newsflash----'

    Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, following on a gory
    description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figures
    of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week,
    the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.

    Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling.
    The telescreen--perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the
    memory of the lost chocolate--crashed into 'Oceania, 'tis for thee'. You
    were supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position he
    was invisible.

    'Oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music. Winston walked over to
    the window, keeping his back to the telescreen. The day was still cold and
    clear. Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating
    roar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at
    present.

    Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the
    word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred principles
    of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt as
    though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a
    monstrous world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The past
    was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a single
    human creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that the
    dominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Like an answer, the three
    slogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him:


    WAR IS PEACE
    FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
    IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH


    He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, in tiny
    clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of
    the coin the head of Big Brother. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you.
    On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on
    the wrappings of a cigarette packet--everywhere. Always the eyes watching
    you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating,
    indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed--no escape. Nothing was your
    own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.

    The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth,
    with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a
    fortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was too
    strong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter
    it down. He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. For the
    future, for the past--for an age that might be imaginary. And in front of
    him there lay not death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced to
    ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he had
    written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. How could
    you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an
    anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?

    The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten minutes. He had to be
    back at work by fourteen-thirty.

    Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him.
    He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. But so
    long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken.
    It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on
    the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:


    To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men
    are different from one another and do not live alone--to a time when truth
    exists and what is done cannot be undone:
    From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of
    Big Brother, from the age of doublethink--greetings!


    He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now,
    when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken
    the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the act
    itself. He wrote:


    Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.


    Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay
    alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.
    It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some nosing zealot
    in the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired
    woman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) might start
    wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had
    used an old-fashioned pen, WHAT he had been writing--and then drop a hint
    in the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed
    the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like
    sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.

    He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless to think of
    hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had
    been discovered. A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious. With the
    tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and
    deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken
    off if the book was moved.




    Chapter 3



    Winston was dreaming of his mother.

    He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had
    disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow
    movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely
    as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered
    especially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearing
    spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one
    of the first great purges of the fifties.

    At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him,
    with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all,
    except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes.
    Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean
    place--the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave--but it
    was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards.
    They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the
    darkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see
    him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the
    green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever.
    He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death,
    and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew
    it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach
    either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they
    must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of
    the unavoidable order of things.

    He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in
    some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his
    own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic
    dream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in which
    one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable
    after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his
    mother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in
    a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the
    ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship,
    and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to
    know the reason. His mother's memory tore at his heart because she had died
    loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and
    because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a
    conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he
    saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but
    no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to
    see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him
    through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.

    Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when
    the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was
    looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain
    whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he
    called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a
    foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged
    hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were
    swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense
    masses like women's hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight,
    there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the
    pools under the willow trees.

    The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With
    what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them
    disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire
    in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant
    was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.
    With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture,
    a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the
    Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid
    movement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.
    Winston woke up with the word 'Shakespeare' on his lips.

    The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on
    the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven fifteen, getting-up
    time for office workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed--naked, for
    a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually,
    and a suit of pyjamas was 600--and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of
    shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in
    three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit
    which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs
    so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back
    and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of
    the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching.

    'Thirty to forty group!' yapped a piercing female voice. 'Thirty to forty
    group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!'

    Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the
    image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and
    gym-shoes, had already appeared.

    'Arms bending and stretching!' she rapped out. 'Take your time by me. ONE,
    two, three, four! ONE, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of
    life into it! ONE, two, three four! ONE two, three, four!...'

    The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston's mind the
    impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise
    restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth,
    wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper
    during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into
    the dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult.
    Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external
    records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost
    its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not
    happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to
    recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you
    could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of
    countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One,
    for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called
    England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been
    called London.

    Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been
    at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of
    peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air
    raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time
    when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid
    itself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as they
    hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round
    a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied
    his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. His
    mother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. She
    was carrying his baby sister--or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets
    that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born
    then. Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had
    realized to be a Tube station.

    There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other
    people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above
    the other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on
    the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by
    side on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap
    pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were
    blue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his
    skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling
    from his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was also
    suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his childish
    way Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond
    forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed
    to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved--a little
    granddaughter, perhaps--had been killed. Every few minutes the old man kept
    repeating:

    'We didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em. I said so, Ma, didn't I? That's what
    comes of trusting 'em. I said so all along. We didn't ought to 'ave trusted
    the buggers.'

    But which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted Winston could not now
    remember.

    Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly
    speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his
    childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some
    of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole
    period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been
    utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made
    mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for
    example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and
    in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever
    admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different
    lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania
    had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was
    merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because
    his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of
    partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore
    Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always
    represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future
    agreement with him was impossible.

    The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he
    forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were
    gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be
    good for the back muscles)--the frightening thing was that it might all be
    true. If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or
    that event, IT NEVER HAPPENED--that, surely, was more terrifying than mere
    torture and death?

    The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He,
    Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short
    a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his
    own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all
    others accepted the lie which the Party imposed--if all records told the
    same tale--then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls
    the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the
    present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature
    alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from
    everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was
    an unending series of victories over your own memory. 'Reality control',
    they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink'.

    'Stand easy!' barked the instructress, a little more genially.

    Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air.
    His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know
    and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling
    carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which
    cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of
    them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim
    to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the
    guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then
    to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and
    then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process
    to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to
    induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of
    the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word
    'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.

    The instructress had called them to attention again. 'And now let's see
    which of us can touch our toes!' she said enthusiastically. 'Right over
    from the hips, please, comrades. ONE-two! ONE-two!...'

    Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from
    his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing
    fit. The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The past, he
    reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For
    how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no
    record outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he had
    first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some
    time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party
    histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the
    Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually
    pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous
    world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their
    strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great
    gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was no
    knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. Winston
    could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into
    existence. He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before
    1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form--'English Socialism',
    that is to say--it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist.
    Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not
    true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the
    Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest
    childhood. But you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just
    once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary
    proof of the falsification of an historical fact. And on that occasion----

    'Smith!' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.!
    Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. You're not
    trying. Lower, please! THAT'S better, comrade. Now stand at ease, the
    whole squad, and watch me.'

    A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston's body. His face
    remained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment!
    A single flicker of the eyes could give you away. He stood watching while
    the instructress raised her arms above her head and--one could not say
    gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency--bent over and
    tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes.

    'THERE, comrades! THAT'S how I want to see you doing it. Watch me again.
    I'm thirty-nine and I've had four children. Now look.' She bent over again.
    'You see MY knees aren't bent. You can all do it if you want to,' she added
    as she straightened herself up. 'Anyone under forty-five is perfectly
    capable of touching his toes. We don't all have the privilege of fighting
    in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. Remember our boys on
    the Malabar front! And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just think
    what THEY have to put up with. Now try again. That's better, comrade,
    that's MUCH better,' she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violent
    lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first
    time in several years.




    Chapter 4



    With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the
    telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started,
    Winston pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the dust from its
    mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped
    together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of
    the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.

    In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the
    speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a
    larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of
    Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last
    was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or
    tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at
    short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed
    memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or
    even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic
    action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in,
    whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous
    furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.

    Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. Each
    contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated
    jargon--not actually Newspeak, but consisting
    largely of Newspeak words--which was used in the Ministry for internal
    purposes. They ran:


    times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectify

    times 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issue

    times 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify

    times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite
    fullwise upsub antefiling


    With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside.
    It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last.
    The other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably
    mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.

    Winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen and called for the
    appropriate issues of 'The Times', which slid out of the pneumatic tube
    after only a few minutes' delay. The messages he had received referred to
    articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought
    necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For
    example, it appeared from 'The Times' of the seventeenth of March that Big
    Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South
    Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly
    be launched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Command
    had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It
    was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, in
    such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or
    again, 'The Times' of the nineteenth of December had published the official
    forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the
    fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth
    Three-Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output,
    from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly
    wrong. Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them
    agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very
    simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short
    a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise
    (a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) that there would be
    no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston
    was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes
    to twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was to
    substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be
    necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.

    As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his
    speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of 'The Times' and pushed
    them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as
    possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes
    that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be
    devoured by the flames.

    What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he
    did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all
    the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number
    of 'The Times' had been assembled and collated, that number would be
    reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on
    the files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was applied
    not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters,
    leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs--to every kind of
    literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or
    ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past
    was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party
    could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any
    item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the
    needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was
    a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was
    necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done,
    to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest section of
    the Records Department, far larger than the one on which Winston worked,
    consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all
    copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded
    and were due for destruction. A number of 'The Times' which might, because
    of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big
    Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing
    its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also,
    were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued
    without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the written
    instructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of
    as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of
    forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors,
    misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the
    interests of accuracy.

    But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's
    figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one
    piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing
    with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of
    connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much
    a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great
    deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For
    example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of
    boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as
    sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked
    the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim
    that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was
    no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very
    likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew
    how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every
    quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps
    half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every
    class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a
    shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become
    uncertain.

    Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding cubicle on the other
    side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named Tillotson was working
    steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close
    to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep what
    he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up,
    and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston's direction.

    Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed
    on. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs.
    In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its
    endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites,
    there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name,
    though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or
    gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next
    to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at
    tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people who had been
    vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was a
    certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple
    of years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy
    creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent
    for juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbled
    versions--definitive texts, they were called--of poems which had become
    ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be
    retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty workers or
    thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the
    huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other
    swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were
    the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts,
    and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. There
    was the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its
    teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There
    were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists
    of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were the vast
    repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden
    furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. And somewhere or other,
    quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole
    effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this
    fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other
    rubbed out of existence.

    And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of
    the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past
    but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks,
    telescreen programmes, plays, novels--with every conceivable kind of
    information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan,
    from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child's
    spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Ministry had not only to
    supply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole
    operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. There
    was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian
    literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were produced
    rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and
    astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and
    sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a
    special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was even
    a whole sub-section--Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak--engaged in
    producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed
    packets and which no Party member, other than those who worked on it,
    was permitted to look at.

    Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was
    working, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before
    the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned
    to his cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the
    speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his
    main job of the morning.

    Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most of it was a
    tedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and
    intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a
    mathematical problem--delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing
    to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your
    estimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this kind
    of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of
    'The Times' leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak.
    He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:


    times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons
    rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling


    In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:


    The reporting of Big Brother's Order for the Day in 'The Times' of December
    3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent
    persons. Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority
    before filing.


    Winston read through the offending article. Big Brother's Order for the
    Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an
    organization known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts
    to the sailors in the Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a
    prominent member of the Inner Party, had been singled out for special
    mention and awarded a decoration, the Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second
    Class.

    Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given.
    One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but
    there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen.
    That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to
    be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges involving
    thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals
    who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed,
    were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of
    years. More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the
    Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had the
    smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they might
    not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not
    counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.

    Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the cubicle
    across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over
    his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile
    spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged
    on the same job as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece
    of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand,
    to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of
    fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a dozen people were
    now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said.
    And presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select this
    version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes
    of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie
    would pass into the permanent records and become truth.

    Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps it was for
    corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of
    a too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had
    been suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps--what was likeliest of
    all--the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a
    necessary part of the mechanics of government. The only real clue lay in
    the words 'refs unpersons', which indicated that Withers was already dead.
    You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were
    arrested. Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty
    for as much as a year or two years before being executed. Very occasionally
    some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly
    reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of
    others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers,
    however, was already an UNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed.
    Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency
    of Big Brother's speech. It was better to make it deal with something
    totally unconnected with its original subject.

    He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and
    thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a
    victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the Ninth
    Three-Year Plan, might complicate the records too much. What was needed
    was a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready
    made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently
    died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when Big
    Brother devoted his Order for the Day to commemorating some humble,
    rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he held up as an example
    worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was
    true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of
    print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into
    existence.

    Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and
    began dictating in Big Brother's familiar style: a style at once military
    and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then
    promptly answering them ('What lessons do we learn from this fact,
    comrades? The lesson--which is also one of the fundamental principles
    of Ingsoc--that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate.

    At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a
    sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At six--a year early, by a special
    relaxation of the rules--he had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a
    troop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police
    after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal
    tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior
    Anti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade which had
    been adopted by the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had
    killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he had
    perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the
    Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his
    machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches
    and all--an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplate
    without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity
    and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life. He was a total abstainer
    and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium,
    and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a
    family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty.
    He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, and
    no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down
    of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally.

    Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of
    Conspicuous Merit: in the end he decided against it because of the
    unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.

    Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something
    seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job
    as himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted,
    but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy,
    unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you
    could create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never
    existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of
    forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the
    same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.




    Chapter 5



    In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked
    slowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. From
    the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour
    metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On
    the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall,
    where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.

    'Just the man I was looking for,' said a voice at Winston's back.

    He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the Research
    Department. Perhaps 'friend' was not exactly the right word. You did not
    have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades whose
    society was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a
    specialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts
    now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary.
    He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large,
    protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search
    your face closely while he was speaking to you.

    'I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades,' he said.

    'Not one!' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. 'I've tried all over
    the place. They don't exist any longer.'

    Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he had two unused ones
    which he was hoarding up. There had been a famine of them for months past.
    At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shops
    were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning
    wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. You could
    only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on
    the 'free' market.

    'I've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he added untruthfully.

    The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he turned and faced
    Syme again. Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end
    of the counter.

    'Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?' said Syme.

    'I was working,' said Winston indifferently. 'I shall see it on the
    flicks, I suppose.'

    'A very inadequate substitute,' said Syme.

    His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face. 'I know you,' the eyes seemed
    to say, 'I see through you. I know very well why you didn't go to see
    those prisoners hanged.' In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously
    orthodox. He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of
    helicopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessions of
    thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
    Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects
    and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on
    which he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head a
    little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.

    'It was a good hanging,' said Syme reminiscently. 'I think it spoils it
    when they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And above
    all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue--a quite bright
    blue. That's the detail that appeals to me.'

    'Nex', please!' yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.

    Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each was
    dumped swiftly the regulation lunch--a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew,
    a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and
    one saccharine tablet.

    'There's a table over there, under that telescreen,' said Syme. 'Let's pick
    up a gin on the way.'

    The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded
    their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the
    metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew,
    a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his
    mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the
    oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he
    suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of
    the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy
    pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of them
    spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the table at
    Winston's left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and
    continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which
    pierced the general uproar of the room.

    'How is the Dictionary getting on?' said Winston, raising his voice to
    overcome the noise.

    'Slowly,' said Syme. 'I'm on the adjectives. It's fascinating.'

    He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak. He pushed his
    pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his
    cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak
    without shouting.

    'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said. 'We're getting
    the language into its final shape--the shape it's going to have when nobody
    speaks anything else. When we've finished with it, people like you will
    have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job
    is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroying words--scores
    of them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting the language down to
    the bone. The Eleventh Edition won't contain a single word that will become
    obsolete before the year 2050.'

    He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then
    continued speaking, with a sort of pedant's passion. His thin dark face
    had become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown
    almost dreamy.

    'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great
    wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns
    that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also
    the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is
    simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in
    itself. Take "good", for instance. If you have a word like "good", what
    need is there for a word like "bad"? "Ungood" will do just as well--better,
    because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you
    want a stronger version of "good", what sense is there in having a whole
    string of vague useless words like "excellent" and "splendid" and all the
    rest of them? "Plusgood" covers the meaning, or "doubleplusgood" if you
    want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. but
    in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the
    whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--in
    reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was
    B.B.'s idea originally, of course,' he added as an afterthought.

    A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention of
    Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of
    enthusiasm.

    'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,' he said almost
    sadly. 'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak. I've read
    some of those pieces that you write in "The Times" occasionally. They're
    good enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stick
    to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning.
    You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that
    Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller
    every year?'

    Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not
    trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of the
    dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:

    'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of
    thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible,
    because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that
    can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning
    rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.
    Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point. But the
    process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year
    fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little
    smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or excuse for committing
    thoughtcrime. It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control.
    But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution will
    be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc
    is Newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. 'Has it ever
    occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a
    single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation
    as we are having now?'

    'Except----' began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.

    It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except the proles,' but he
    checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in
    some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.

    'The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. 'By 2050--earlier,
    probably--all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole
    literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare,
    Milton, Byron--they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed
    into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory
    of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change.
    Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like "freedom is
    slavery" when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate
    of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we
    understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think.
    Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.'

    One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will
    be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too
    plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear.
    It is written in his face.

    Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways
    in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left the man
    with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young
    woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back
    to Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with
    everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remark
    as 'I think you're so right, I do so agree with you', uttered in a youthful
    and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an
    instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight,
    though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post
    in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular
    throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and
    because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the
    light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was
    slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of
    his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just
    once Winston caught a phrase--'complete and final elimination of
    Goldsteinism'--jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece,
    like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a
    quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the
    man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.
    He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against
    thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the
    atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the
    heroes on the Malabar front--it made no difference. Whatever it was, you
    could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.
    As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down,
    Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but
    some kind of dummy. It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was
    his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but
    it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in
    unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.

    Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was
    tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other table
    quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.

    'There is a word in Newspeak,' said Syme, 'I don't know whether you know
    it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting words
    that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse,
    applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.'

    Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thought
    it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him
    and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a
    thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something
    subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion,
    aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was
    unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big
    Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with
    sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of
    information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint
    air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have
    been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut
    Tree Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an
    unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the place
    was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been
    used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself,
    it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme's
    fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme
    grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secret
    opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So would
    anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not
    enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.

    Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said.

    Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'that bloody fool'.
    Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading
    his way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a
    froglike face. At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at
    neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole
    appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although
    he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to
    think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red
    neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture of
    dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did,
    indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other
    physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both
    with a cheery 'Hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off an
    intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.
    His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Centre you
    could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of
    the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a
    long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his
    fingers.

    'Look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said Parsons, nudging
    Winston. 'Keenness, eh? What's that you've got there, old boy? Something
    a bit too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'm
    chasing you. It's that sub you forgot to give me.'

    'Which sub is that?' said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About
    a quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions,
    which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.

    'For Hate Week. You know--the house-by-house fund. I'm treasurer for our
    block. We're making an all-out effort--going to put on a tremendous show.
    I tell you, it won't be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have the
    biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.'

    Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons
    entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.

    'By the way, old boy,' he said. 'I hear that little beggar of mine let fly
    at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good dressing-down for it.
    In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does it again.'

    'I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,' said
    Winston.

    'Ah, well--what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it?
    Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness!
    All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. D'you know what
    that little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike
    out Berkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off
    from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. They
    kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when
    they got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.'

    'What did they do that for?' said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsons
    went on triumphantly:

    'My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent--might have been dropped
    by parachute, for instance. But here's the point, old boy. What do you
    think put her on to him in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a
    funny kind of shoes--said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that
    before. So the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipper
    of seven, eh?'

    'What happened to the man?' said Winston.

    'Ah, that I couldn't say, of course. But I wouldn't be altogether surprised
    if----' Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue
    for the explosion.

    'Good,' said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.

    'Of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed Winston dutifully.

    'What I mean to say, there is a war on,' said Parsons.

    As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the
    telescreen just above their heads. However, it was not the proclamation of
    a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry
    of Plenty.

    'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'Attention, comrades! We have
    glorious news for you. We have won the battle for production! Returns now
    completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the
    standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past
    year. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous
    demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and
    paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big
    Brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed
    upon us. Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs----'

    The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. It had been a
    favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention
    caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity,
    a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was
    aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged
    out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.
    With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to
    fill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he
    held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and
    he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to
    the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the
    telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank
    Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And
    only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was
    to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could
    swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons
    swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature
    at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious
    desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that
    last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too--in some more
    complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONE
    in the possession of a memory?

    The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As
    compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses,
    more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,
    more books, more babies--more of everything except disease, crime, and
    insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was
    whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up
    his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across
    the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated
    resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like
    this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen.
    A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of
    innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close
    together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays,
    coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a
    sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and
    dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort
    of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had
    a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly
    different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never
    been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that
    were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety,
    rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces,
    bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes
    insufficient--nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though,
    of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this
    was NOT the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the
    discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness
    of one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty
    soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil
    tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind
    of ancestral memory that things had once been different?

    He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and would
    still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue
    overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small,
    curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes
    darting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought
    Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type
    set up by the Party as an ideal--tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed
    maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree--existed and even
    predominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people
    in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curious how that
    beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing
    stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and
    fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to
    flourish best under the dominion of the Party.

    The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call
    and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the
    bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.

    'The Ministry of Plenty's certainly done a good job this year,' he said
    with a knowing shake of his head. 'By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose
    you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?'

    'Not one,' said Winston. 'I've been using the same blade for six weeks
    myself.'

    'Ah, well--just thought I'd ask you, old boy.'

    'Sorry,' said Winston.

    The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the
    Ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For some
    reason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her
    wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those
    children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would
    be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O'Brien
    would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.
    The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.
    The little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine
    corridors of Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl
    with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department--she would never be
    vaporized either. It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would
    survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for
    survival, it was not easy to say.

    At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The
    girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. It
    was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but
    with curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away
    again.

    The sweat started out on Winston's backbone. A horrible pang of terror
    went through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging
    uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following him
    about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at
    the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, at
    any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him
    when there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had
    been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.

    His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member
    of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was
    the greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been looking
    at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible
    that his features had not been perfectly under control. It was terribly
    dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place
    or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away.
    A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to
    yourself--anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of
    having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on
    your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example)
    was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak:
    FACECRIME, it was called.

    The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was not
    really following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so
    close to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it
    carefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work,
    if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next
    table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in the
    cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end
    must not be wasted. Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it
    away in his pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.

    'Did I ever tell you, old boy,' he said, chuckling round the stem of his
    pipe, 'about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old
    market-woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster
    of B.B.? Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches.
    Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But keen as mustard!
    That's a first-rate training they give them in the Spies nowadays--better
    than in my day, even. What d'you think's the latest thing they've served
    them out with? Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes! My little
    girl brought one home the other night--tried it out on our sitting-room
    door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the
    hole. Of course it's only a toy, mind you. Still, gives 'em the right
    idea, eh?'

    At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. It was the
    signal to return to work. All three men sprang to their feet to join in
    the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of
    Winston's cigarette.




    Chapter 6



    Winston was writing in his diary:


    It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow
    side-street near one of the big railway stations. She was standing near a
    doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. She
    had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed
    to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party
    women never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the street, and no
    telescreens. She said two dollars. I----


    For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressed
    his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept
    recurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of
    filthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall,
    to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window--to do any
    violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was
    tormenting him.

    Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment
    the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible
    symptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks
    back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to
    forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few metres
    apart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sort
    of spasm. It happened again just as they were passing one another: it was
    only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but
    obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is
    done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly
    unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There
    was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.

    He drew his breath and went on writing:


    I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a
    basement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the
    table, turned down very low. She----


    His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. Simultaneously
    with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine, his wife.
    Winston was married--had been married, at any rate: probably he still was
    married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe
    again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded
    of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless
    alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be
    imagined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the smell
    of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.

    When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years
    or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but
    it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to
    break. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be
    caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp:
    not more, if you had committed no other offence. And it was easy enough,
    provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters
    swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could even be
    purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink.
    Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet
    for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery
    did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and only
    involved the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgivable
    crime was promiscuity between Party members. But--though this was one
    of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed
    to--it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.

    The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming
    loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclared
    purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much
    as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All
    marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee
    appointed for the purpose, and--though the principle was never clearly
    stated--permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave
    the impression of being physically attracted to one another. The only
    recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of
    the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting
    minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into plain
    words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from
    childhood onwards. There were even organizations such as the Junior
    Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. All
    children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (ARTSEM, it was
    called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston
    was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in
    with the general ideology of the Party. The Party was trying to kill the
    sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty
    it. He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should
    be so. And as far as the women were concerned, the Party's efforts were
    largely successful.

    He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten--nearly eleven years
    since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her. For
    days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married.
    They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did not
    permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there
    were no children.

    Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid
    movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called
    noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing
    behind it. Very early in her married life he had decided--though perhaps
    it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people--that
    she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had
    ever encountered. She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan,
    and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of
    swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. 'The human sound-track' he
    nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living with her
    if it had not been for just one thing--sex.

    As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace her
    was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was that
    even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she
    was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity
    of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there
    with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It was
    extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then
    he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should
    remain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.
    They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performance
    continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not
    impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something
    which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had
    two names for it. One was 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty to
    the Party' (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he grew to
    have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. But
    luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying,
    and soon afterwards they parted.

    Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and
    wrote:


    She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of
    preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up
    her skirt. I----


    He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs
    and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and
    resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of
    Katharine's white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party.
    Why did it always have to be like this? Why could he not have a woman of
    his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? But a real
    love affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women of the Party were
    all alike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By
    careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that
    was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, by
    lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling
    had been driven out of them. His reason told him that there must be
    exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable,
    as the Party intended that they should be. And what he wanted, more even
    than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were
    only once in his whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was
    rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if he
    could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was
    his wife.

    But the rest of the story had got to be written down. He wrote:


    I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light----


    After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very
    bright. For the first time he could see the woman properly. He had taken a
    step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He was painfully
    conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly
    possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter
    they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. If he went away
    without even doing what he had come here to do----!

    It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. What he had
    suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was OLD. The paint was
    plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack
    like a cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the
    truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open,
    revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no teeth at all.

    He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:


    When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old
    at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.


    He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had written it down
    at last, but it made no difference. The therapy had not worked. The urge
    to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.




    Chapter 7



    'If there is hope,' wrote Winston, 'it lies in the proles.'

    If there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles, because only there in those
    swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania,
    could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could
    not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had
    no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if
    the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was
    inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than
    twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the
    voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only
    they could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would have no
    need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like
    a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to
    pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to
    do it? And yet----!

    He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a
    tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women's voices--had burst from a
    side-street a little way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger
    and despair, a deep, loud 'Oh-o-o-o-oh!' that went humming on like the
    reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It's started! he had thought.
    A riot! The proles are breaking loose at last! When he had reached the spot
    it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls
    of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed
    passengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair broke
    down into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the
    stalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things,
    but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supply
    had unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by
    the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of
    others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism
    and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh
    outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming
    down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of
    one another's hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then the
    handle came off. Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a
    moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only
    a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that
    about anything that mattered?

    He wrote:


    Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they
    have rebelled they cannot become conscious.


    That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the
    Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles
    from bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by
    the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced
    to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a
    matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age
    of six. But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the
    Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in
    subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. In
    reality very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to
    know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other
    activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned
    loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life
    that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were
    born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed
    through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married
    at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part,
    at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty
    quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling,
    filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not
    difficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them,
    spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few
    individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt
    was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not
    desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that
    was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to
    whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or
    shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes
    did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas,
    they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils
    invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even
    have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them
    very little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole
    world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and
    racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles
    themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were
    allowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the
    Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce
    was permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been
    permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it.
    They were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: 'Proles and
    animals are free.'

    Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. It
    had begun itching again. The thing you invariably came back to was the
    impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been
    like. He took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook
    which he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage into
    the diary:


    In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution, London was
    not the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserable
    place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and
    thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to
    sleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for
    cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and
    fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water. But in among all
    this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses
    that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look
    after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly
    men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page.
    You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a
    frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was
    called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else
    was allowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in the world, and
    everyone else was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses,
    all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could
    throw them into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to
    death. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and
    bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as 'Sir'. The chief of
    all the capitalists was called the King, and----


    But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be mention of the
    bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the
    pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o'-nine tails, the Lord Mayor's
    Banquet, and the practice of kissing the Pope's toe. There was also
    something called the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, which would probably not be
    mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law by which every
    capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his
    factories.

    How could you tell how much of it was lies? It MIGHT be true that the
    average human being was better off now than he had been before the
    Revolution. The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your
    own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were
    intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. It
    struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not
    its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its
    listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only
    to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals
    that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Party
    member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary
    jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging
    a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the
    Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering--a world of steel
    and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons--a nation of
    warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the
    same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting,
    triumphing, persecuting--three hundred million people all with the same
    face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled
    to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that
    smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of
    London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it
    was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair,
    fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.

    He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day and night the
    telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today
    had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations--that they
    lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger,
    happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years
    ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed,
    for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate: before
    the Revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent. The
    Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per
    thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300--and so it went
    on. It was like a single equation with two unknowns. It might very well be
    that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one
    accepted without question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there might
    never have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, or any such creature
    as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat.

    Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten,
    the lie became truth. Just once in his life he had possessed--AFTER the
    event: that was what counted--concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of
    falsification. He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty
    seconds. In 1973, it must have been--at any rate, it was at about the time
    when he and Katharine had parted. But the really relevant date was seven
    or eight years earlier.

    The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great
    purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out
    once and for all. By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brother
    himself. All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and
    counter-revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew
    where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority
    had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made
    confession of their crimes. Among the last survivors were three men named
    Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three
    had been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more,
    so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had
    suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way.
    They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the
    enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various
    trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother
    which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage
    causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing to
    these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given
    posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. All three
    had written long, abject articles in 'The Times', analysing the reasons
    for their defection and promising to make amends.

    Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them
    in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered the sort of terrified fascination
    with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were men
    far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great
    figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the
    underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had
    the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing
    blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that
    of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed
    with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had
    once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end.
    They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.

    There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise
    even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sitting
    in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the
    speciality of the cafe. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance
    had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist,
    whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and
    during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were
    appearing in The Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier
    manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a
    rehashing of the ancient themes--slum tenements, starving children, street
    battles, capitalists in top hats--even on the barricades the capitalists
    still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort to
    get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy
    grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one
    time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging,
    sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking
    up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling.

    It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now remember how he
    had come to be in the cafe at such a time. The place was almost empty. A
    tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their
    corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought
    fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with
    the pieces set out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute
    in all, something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they were
    playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came into
    it--but it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked,
    braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note. And
    then a voice from the telescreen was singing:


    Under the spreading chestnut tree
    I sold you and you sold me:
    There lie they, and here lie we
    Under the spreading chestnut tree.


    The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford's
    ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first
    time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing
    AT WHAT he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.

    A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they had
    engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At
    their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with
    a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded
    in the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after
    this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just
    flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment
    of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then
    forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.
    It was a half-page torn out of 'The Times' of about ten years earlier--the
    top half of the page, so that it included the date--and it contained a
    photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent
    in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was
    no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the
    bottom.

    The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that
    date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield
    in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with
    members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important
    military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced
    to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless
    other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the
    confessions were lies.

    Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston
    had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had
    actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was
    concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil
    bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory.
    It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have
    been published to the world and its significance made known.

    He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph
    was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper.
    Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of
    view of the telescreen.

    He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as
    to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face
    expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be
    controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your
    heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let
    what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the
    fear that some accident--a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for
    instance--would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped
    the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers.
    Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.

    That was ten--eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that
    photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers
    seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself,
    as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party's hold
    upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which
    existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?

    But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes,
    the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he
    made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must
    have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed
    their country. Since then there had been other changes--two, three,
    he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been
    rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer
    had the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changed
    continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that
    he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken.
    The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the
    ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:


    I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.


    He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was
    a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it
    had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun;
    today, to believe that the past is unalterable. He might be ALONE in
    holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being
    a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also
    be wrong.

    He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of
    Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into
    his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon
    you--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your
    brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to
    deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that
    two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable
    that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their
    position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very
    existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The
    heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that
    they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.
    For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the
    force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past
    and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is
    controllable what then?

    But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. The face
    of O'Brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his
    mind. He knew, with more certainty than before, that O'Brien was on his
    side. He was writing the diary for O'Brien--TO O'Brien: it was like an
    interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed
    to a particular person and took its colour from that fact.

    The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was
    their final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought of
    the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party
    intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he
    would not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the
    right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the
    true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid
    world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet,
    objects unsupported fall towards the earth's centre. With the feeling that
    he was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important
    axiom, he wrote:


    Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is
    granted, all else follows.




    Chapter 8



    From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting
    coffee--real coffee, not Victory Coffee--came floating out into the street.
    Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the
    half-forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut
    off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.

    He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer
    was throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed
    an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain
    that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked.
    In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except
    in bed. It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping
    he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything
    that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself,
    was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak:
    OWNLIFE, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But this
    evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had
    tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and
    suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting
    games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed
    intolerable. On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered
    off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again,
    losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which
    direction he was going.

    'If there is hope,' he had written in the diary, 'it lies in the proles.'
    The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a
    palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums
    to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was
    walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered
    doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow
    curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of filthy water here
    and there among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down
    narrow alley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in
    astonishing numbers--girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths,
    and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you
    what the girls would be like in ten years' time, and old bent creatures
    shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played
    in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers.
    Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up.
    Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a
    sort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms
    folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught
    scraps of conversation as he approached.

    '"Yes," I says to 'er, "that's all very well," I says. "But if you'd of
    been in my place you'd of done the same as what I done. It's easy to
    criticize," I says, "but you ain't got the same problems as what I got."'

    'Ah,' said the other, 'that's jest it. That's jest where it is.'

    The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostile
    silence as he went past. But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind
    of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar
    animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a
    street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless
    you had definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happened
    to run into them. 'May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here?
    What time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?'--and so on and
    so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual
    route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police
    heard about it.

    Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning
    from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A
    young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a
    tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back
    again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like
    black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston,
    pointing excitedly to the sky.

    'Steamer!' he yelled. 'Look out, guv'nor! Bang over'ead! Lay down quick!'

    'Steamer' was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to
    rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were
    nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed
    to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance
    when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster
    than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar
    that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered
    on to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with
    fragments of glass from the nearest window.

    He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the
    street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of
    plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There
    was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in
    the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he
    saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody
    stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.

    He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned
    down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out
    of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of
    the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly
    twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs',
    they called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors,
    endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust,
    and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men
    were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a
    folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder.
    Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces,
    Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was
    obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few
    paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men
    were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point
    of blows.

    'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number ending
    in seven ain't won for over fourteen months!'

    'Yes, it 'as, then!'

    'No, it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years
    wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. An'
    I tell you, no number ending in seven----'

    'Yes, a seven 'AS won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.
    Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in February--second week in February.'

    'February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and white. An' I
    tell you, no number----'

    'Oh, pack it in!' said the third man.

    They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gone
    thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.
    The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public
    event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that
    there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal
    if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their
    folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was
    concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of
    intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole
    tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and
    lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery,
    which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed
    everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.
    Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being
    non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between
    one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.

    But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that.
    When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at
    the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of
    faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling
    that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main
    thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of
    shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight
    of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers
    were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered
    where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next
    turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the
    blank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer's shop not
    far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.

    He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of
    the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted
    over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but
    active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn,
    pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it
    occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had
    already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others
    like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of
    capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas
    had been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly
    been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few
    who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual
    surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful
    account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a
    prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into
    his diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold
    of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that
    old man and question him. He would say to him: 'Tell me about your life
    when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better
    than they are now, or were they worse?'

    Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the
    steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of course. As usual,
    there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their
    pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the
    patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not
    likely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous
    cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of
    voices dropped to about half its volume. Behind his back he could feel
    everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at
    the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty
    seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having
    some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young
    man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses
    in their hands, were watching the scene.

    'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?' said the old man, straightening his
    shoulders pugnaciously. 'You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the
    'ole bleeding boozer?'

    'And what in hell's name IS a pint?' said the barman, leaning forward with
    the tips of his fingers on the counter.

    ''Ark at 'im! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why,
    a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon.
    'Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.'

    'Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre and half
    litre--that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelf in front
    of you.'

    'I likes a pint,' persisted the old man. 'You could 'a drawed me off a pint
    easy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.'

    'When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,' said the
    barman, with a glance at the other customers.

    There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry
    seemed to disappear. The old man's white-stubbled face had flushed pink. He
    turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught
    him gently by the arm.

    'May I offer you a drink?' he said.

    'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He
    appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls. 'Pint!' he added
    aggressively to the barman. 'Pint of wallop.'

    The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses
    which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink
    you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin,
    though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of
    darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun
    talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was forgotten for a
    moment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man
    could talk without fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but
    at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure
    of as soon as he came in.

    ''E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old man as he settled down
    behind a glass. 'A 'alf litre ain't enough. It don't satisfy. And a 'ole
    litre's too much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the price.'

    'You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,' said
    Winston tentatively.

    The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and
    from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-room
    that he expected the changes to have occurred.

    'The beer was better,' he said finally. 'And cheaper! When I was a young
    man, mild beer--wallop we used to call it--was fourpence a pint. That was
    before the war, of course.'

    'Which war was that?' said Winston.

    'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and his
    shoulders straightened again. ''Ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth!'

    In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam's apple made a surprisingly rapid
    up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar and
    came back with two more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten
    his prejudice against drinking a full litre.

    'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston. 'You must have been a
    grown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the old
    days, before the Revolution. People of my age don't really know anything
    about those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it says
    in the books may not be true. I should like your opinion on that. The
    history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different
    from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice,
    poverty worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass
    of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them
    hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left
    school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were
    a very few people, only a few thousands--the capitalists, they were
    called--who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was
    to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they
    rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne,
    they wore top hats----'

    The old man brightened suddenly.

    'Top 'ats!' he said. 'Funny you should mention 'em. The same thing come
    into my 'ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was jest thinking, I ain't seen
    a top 'at in years. Gorn right out, they 'ave. The last time I wore one
    was at my sister-in-law's funeral. And that was--well, I couldn't give you
    the date, but it must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 'ired
    for the occasion, you understand.'

    'It isn't very important about the top hats,' said Winston patiently.
    'The point is, these capitalists--they and a few lawyers and priests and
    so forth who lived on them--were the lords of the earth. Everything existed
    for their benefit. You--the ordinary people, the workers--were their
    slaves. They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you off to
    Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.
    They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine
    tails. You had to take your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist
    went about with a gang of lackeys who----'

    The old man brightened again.

    'Lackeys!' he said. 'Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long.
    Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that does. I recollect--oh, donkey's
    years ago--I used to sometimes go to 'Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to
    'ear the blokes making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews,
    Indians--all sorts there was. And there was one bloke--well, I couldn't
    give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was. 'E didn't 'alf
    give it 'em! "Lackeys!" 'e says, "lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies of
    the ruling class!" Parasites--that was another of them. And 'yenas--'e
    definitely called 'em 'yenas. Of course 'e was referring to the Labour
    Party, you understand.'

    Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes.

    'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said. 'Do you feel that you
    have more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated more
    like a human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at the
    top----'

    'The 'Ouse of Lords,' put in the old man reminiscently.

    'The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, were these people
    able to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and you
    were poor? Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them "Sir" and
    take off your cap when you passed them?'

    The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a quarter of his
    beer before answering.

    'Yes,' he said. 'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em. It showed
    respect, like. I didn't agree with it, myself, but I done it often enough.
    Had to, as you might say.'

    'And was it usual--I'm only quoting what I've read in history books--was
    it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement
    into the gutter?'

    'One of 'em pushed me once,' said the old man. 'I recollect it as if it
    was yesterday. It was Boat Race night--terribly rowdy they used to get on
    Boat Race night--and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.
    Quite a gent, 'e was--dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kind
    of zig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into 'im accidental-like.
    'E says, "Why can't you look where you're going?" 'e says. I say, "Ju think
    you've bought the bleeding pavement?" 'E says, "I'll twist your bloody 'ead
    off if you get fresh with me." I says, "You're drunk. I'll give you in
    charge in 'alf a minute," I says. An' if you'll believe me, 'e puts 'is
    'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the
    wheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them days, and I was going to 'ave
    fetched 'im one, only----'

    A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old man's memory was
    nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all day
    without getting any real information. The party histories might still be
    true, after a fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last
    attempt.

    'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said. 'What I'm trying to say
    is this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life
    before the Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.
    Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better
    than it is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live
    then or now?'

    The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He finished up his
    beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerant
    philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.

    'I know what you expect me to say,' he said. 'You expect me to say as I'd
    sooner be young again. Most people'd say they'd sooner be young, if you
    arst 'em. You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young. When you
    get to my time of life you ain't never well. I suffer something wicked
    from my feet, and my bladder's jest terrible. Six and seven times a night
    it 'as me out of bed. On the other 'and, there's great advantages in being
    a old man. You ain't got the same worries. No truck with women, and that's
    a great thing. I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd
    credit it. Nor wanted to, what's more.'

    Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use going on. He was
    about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled
    rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra
    half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two
    gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out
    into the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the
    huge and simple question, 'Was life better before the Revolution than it
    is now?' would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect
    it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the
    ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They
    remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for
    a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, the
    swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant
    facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant,
    which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and
    written records were falsified--when that happened, the claim of the Party
    to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted,
    because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard
    against which it could be tested.

    At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked
    up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed
    among dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three
    discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He
    seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop
    where he had bought the diary.

    A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to
    buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the
    place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander,
    his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely
    against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself
    by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it was
    nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. With the feeling that he
    would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he
    stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could plausibly say that
    he was trying to buy razor blades.

    The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an
    unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and
    bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick
    spectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and
    still black. His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact
    that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air
    of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or
    perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent
    less debased than that of the majority of proles.

    'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately. 'You're the
    gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album. That was a beautiful
    bit of paper, that was. Cream-laid, it used to be called. There's been no
    paper like that made for--oh, I dare say fifty years.' He peered at Winston
    over the top of his spectacles. 'Is there anything special I can do for
    you? Or did you just want to look round?'

    'I was passing,' said Winston vaguely. 'I just looked in. I don't want
    anything in particular.'

    'It's just as well,' said the other, 'because I don't suppose I could have
    satisfied you.' He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand.
    'You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, the
    antique trade's just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock
    either. Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees. And
    of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I haven't seen a brass
    candlestick in years.'

    The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there
    was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The floorspace was very
    restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty
    picture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out
    chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even
    pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a
    small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends--lacquered
    snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like--which looked as though they might
    include something interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table his
    eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the
    lamplight, and he picked it up.

    It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making
    almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in
    both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified
    by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that
    recalled a rose or a sea anemone.

    'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.

    'That's coral, that is,' said the old man. 'It must have come from the
    Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasn't made
    less than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it.'

    'It's a beautiful thing,' said Winston.

    'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively. 'But there's not
    many that'd say so nowadays.' He coughed. 'Now, if it so happened that you
    wanted to buy it, that'd cost you four dollars. I can remember when a thing
    like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was--well, I
    can't work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares about genuine
    antiques nowadays--even the few that's left?'

    Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing
    into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty
    as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different
    from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass
    that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its
    apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been
    intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately
    it did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising
    thing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and for
    that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had
    grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston
    realized that he would have accepted three or even two.

    'There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,' he
    said. 'There's not much in it. Just a few pieces. We'll do with a light if
    we're going upstairs.'

    He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the
    steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did
    not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of
    chimney-pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as
    though the room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on
    the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair
    drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour
    face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying
    nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still
    on it.

    'We lived here till my wife died,' said the old man half apologetically.
    'I'm selling the furniture off by little and little. Now that's a beautiful
    mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it.
    But I dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome.'

    He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and
    in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought
    flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to
    rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It
    was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but
    the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral
    memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in
    a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in
    the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with
    nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing
    of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.

    'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.

    'Ah,' said the old man, 'I never had one of those things. Too expensive.
    And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now that's a nice
    gateleg table in the corner there. Though of course you'd have to put new
    hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.'

    There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already
    gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down
    and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the
    prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed
    anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old
    man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a
    rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite
    the bed.

    'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all----' he began
    delicately.

    Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of an
    oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There
    was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was
    what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It
    seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.

    'The frame's fixed to the wall,' said the old man, 'but I could unscrew it
    for you, I dare say.'

    'I know that building,' said Winston finally. 'It's a ruin now. It's in
    the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.'

    'That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in--oh, many years
    ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement Danes, its name was.' He
    smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly
    ridiculous, and added: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!'

    'What's that?' said Winston.

    'Oh--"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's." That was a rhyme
    we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I don't remember, but I do
    know it ended up, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a
    chopper to chop off your head." It was a kind of a dance. They held out
    their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to "Here comes a
    chopper to chop off your head" they brought their arms down and caught you.
    It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it--all the
    principal ones, that is.'

    Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was always
    difficult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large and
    impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically
    claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was
    obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle
    Ages. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any
    value. One could not learn history from architecture any more than one
    could learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the
    names of streets--anything that might throw light upon the past had been
    systematically altered.

    'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.

    'There's a lot of them left, really,' said the old man, 'though they've
    been put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go? Ah! I've got it!


    "Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,
    You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's----"


    there, now, that's as far as I can get. A farthing, that was a small copper
    coin, looked something like a cent.'

    'Where was St Martin's?' said Winston.

    'St Martin's? That's still standing. It's in Victory Square, alongside the
    picture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars
    in front, and a big flight of steps.'

    Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda displays
    of various kinds--scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses,
    waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.

    'St Martin's-in-the-Fields it used to be called,' supplemented the old man,
    'though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.'

    Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even more
    incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry
    home, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some
    minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not
    Weeks--as one might have gathered from the inscription over the
    shop-front--but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged
    sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. Throughout that
    time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never
    quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that they were talking
    the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head. Oranges and
    lemons say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say
    the bells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to yourself
    you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London
    that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one
    ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so
    far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells
    ringing.

    He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not
    to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of
    the door. He had already made up his mind that after a suitable
    interval--a month, say--he would take the risk of visiting the shop again.
    It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre.
    The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place,
    after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the
    shop could be trusted. However----!

    Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps of
    beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes, take
    it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his
    overalls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington's
    memory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed
    momentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five seconds exaltation
    made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much
    as a preliminary glance through the window. He had even started humming
    to an improvised tune


    Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,
    You owe me three farthings, say the----


    Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. A figure
    in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It was
    the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light
    was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked
    him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not
    seen him.

    For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to the
    right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was
    going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There
    was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have
    followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she
    should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure
    backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived.
    It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the
    Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly
    mattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seen
    him go into the pub as well.

    It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged against
    his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it
    away. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes
    he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon.
    But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the
    spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.

    The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for several seconds
    wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his
    steps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him
    three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her.
    He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then
    smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket
    would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately,
    because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He
    could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lusty
    and would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the Community
    Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a
    partial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly
    lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly and
    then sit down and be quiet.

    It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. The lights
    would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into the
    kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to
    the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer.
    But he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice
    was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the
    book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.

    It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thing
    was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so.
    Many of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed desperate
    courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and
    certain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of
    astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery
    of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment
    when a special effort is needed. He might have silenced the dark-haired
    girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the
    extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him that
    in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but
    always against one's own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull
    ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same,
    he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the
    battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that
    you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until
    it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or
    screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or
    cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.

    He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The woman
    on the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed to stick into
    his brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien,
    for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking
    of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him
    away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed was
    what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet
    everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to
    be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the
    crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair.

    Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why was
    it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever
    escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had
    succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be
    dead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded
    in future time?

    He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of
    O'Brien. 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' O'Brien
    had said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where
    there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see,
    but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with the
    voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train
    of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco
    promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to
    spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that
    of O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of
    his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm,
    protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?
    Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:


    WAR IS PEACE
    FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
    IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH





    PART TWO




    Chapter 1



    It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the cubicle to go
    to the lavatory.

    A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long,
    brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone
    past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop.
    As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable
    at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably
    she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes
    on which the plots of novels were 'roughed in'. It was a common accident
    in the Fiction Department.

    They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost
    flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must have
    fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen
    to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her
    mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an
    appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.

    A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemy
    who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature,
    in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively
    started forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on
    the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.

    'You're hurt?' he said.

    'It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.'

    She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had certainly turned
    very pale.

    'You haven't broken anything?'

    'No, I'm all right. It hurt for a moment, that's all.'

    She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. She had regained
    some of her colour, and appeared very much better.

    'It's nothing,' she repeated shortly. 'I only gave my wrist a bit of a
    bang. Thanks, comrade!'

    And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going,
    as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident could
    not have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear
    in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct,
    and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen
    when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to
    betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was
    helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no
    question that she had done it intentionally. It was something small and
    flat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his
    pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paper
    folded into a square.

    While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to
    get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on
    it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets
    and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.
    There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens
    were watched continuously.

    He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper
    casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and
    hitched the speakwrite towards him. 'Five minutes,' he told himself,
    'five minutes at the very least!' His heart bumped in his breast with
    frightening loudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was
    mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing
    close attention.

    Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political
    meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, much
    the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police,
    just as he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should
    choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had
    their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a
    summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. But there
    was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he
    tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come from
    the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organization.
    Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it!
    No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very
    instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a couple
    of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to
    him. And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably
    meant death--still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable
    hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he
    kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the
    speakwrite.

    He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic
    tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose,
    sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of
    paper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large
    unformed handwriting:

    I LOVE YOU.

    For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating
    thing into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very well the
    danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once
    again, just to make sure that the words were really there.

    For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. What was even
    worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the
    need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a
    fire were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled
    canteen was torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while during
    the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped
    down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of
    stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.
    He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of Big
    Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by
    his daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket
    of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was
    constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once
    he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the
    far end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not
    look in that direction again.

    The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a
    delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and
    necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a
    series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast
    discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under a
    cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for more
    than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind
    altogether. Then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging,
    intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible
    to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the
    Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried
    off to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a 'discussion group',
    played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and
    sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled 'Ingsoc in relation to
    chess'. His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse
    to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU
    the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor
    risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he
    was home and in bed--in the darkness, where you were safe even from the
    telescreen so long as you kept silent--that he was able to think
    continuously.

    It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with
    the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer the
    possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew
    that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed
    him the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well
    she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his
    mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with
    a cobblestone, but that was of no importance. He thought of her naked,
    youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a fool
    like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her
    belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might
    lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he feared
    more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he
    did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of
    meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when you
    were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you.
    Actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to
    him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think,
    he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments
    on a table.

    Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not
    be repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might have
    been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in
    the building the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going
    there. If he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work,
    he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try
    to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about
    outside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a
    letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine that
    was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few
    people ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionally
    necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases,
    and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not
    know the girl's name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the
    safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself,
    somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and
    with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round--if these conditions
    endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few
    words.

    For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day she
    did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having
    already blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift. They
    passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the
    canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately
    under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at
    all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable
    sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every
    sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an
    agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He did
    not touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in
    his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a
    stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There
    was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might
    have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end
    of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her
    mind and decided to avoid him.

    The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had a
    band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing her was
    so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several
    seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her.
    When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the
    wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full.
    The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was
    held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he
    had not received his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone
    when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. He walked
    casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond
    her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds would
    do it. Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended not to hear.
    'Smith!' repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round.
    A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew,
    was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not
    safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit at
    a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with
    a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a
    hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it.
    The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.

    But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take
    the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely enough, she was at
    a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediately
    ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man
    with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from
    the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight
    for the girl's table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a
    table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested
    that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the
    emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston followed. It was no use
    unless he could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendous
    crash. The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying,
    two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He started
    to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently
    suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds
    later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl's table.

    He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating.
    It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now
    a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by since
    she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must
    have changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should end
    successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might have
    flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen
    Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with
    a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth
    was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if
    he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both
    Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was
    a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston
    began speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the
    watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few
    necessary words in low expressionless voices.

    'What time do you leave work?'

    'Eighteen-thirty.'

    'Where can we meet?'

    'Victory Square, near the monument.'

    'It's full of telescreens.'

    'It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.'

    'Any signal?'

    'No. Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. And don't
    look at me. Just keep somewhere near me.'

    'What time?'

    'Nineteen hours.'

    'All right.'

    Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table. They did
    not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on
    opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. The
    girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to
    smoke a cigarette.

    Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered round
    the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother's
    statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the
    Eurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years
    ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there was
    a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver
    Cromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared.
    Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she had
    changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of the square and
    got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin's Church,
    whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed 'You owe me three farthings.'
    Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading or
    pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. It was not
    safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There were
    telescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was a din of
    shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly
    everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly
    round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush.
    Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that
    a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.

    Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square.
    Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer
    edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward
    into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of the girl,
    but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous
    woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of
    flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed
    to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his
    entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he
    had broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were
    shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.

    A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machine
    guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street.
    In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting,
    jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides
    of the trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there
    was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons.
    Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed. Winston knew they
    were there but he saw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, and
    her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was
    almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken
    charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began
    speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely
    moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling
    of the trucks.

    'Can you hear me?'

    'Yes.'

    'Can you get Sunday afternoon off?'

    'Yes.'

    'Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember this. Go to Paddington
    Station----'

    With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she outlined the
    route that he was to follow. A half-hour railway journey; turn left outside
    the station; two kilometres along the road; a gate with the top bar
    missing; a path across a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes;
    a dead tree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside her
    head. 'Can you remember all that?' she murmured finally.

    'Yes.'

    'You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate's got no top bar.'

    'Yes. What time?'

    'About fifteen. You may have to wait. I'll get there by another way. Are
    you sure you remember everything?'

    'Yes.'

    'Then get away from me as quick as you can.'

    She need not have told him that. But for the moment they could not
    extricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were still filing past,
    the people still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boos
    and hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and
    had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners,
    whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. One
    literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as
    prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did
    one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as
    war-criminals: the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labour
    camps. The round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European
    type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyes
    looked into Winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away
    again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an
    aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists
    crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them bound
    together. It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part. But at the
    last moment, while the crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for his
    and gave it a fleeting squeeze.

    It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that
    their hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detail
    of her hand. He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the
    work-hardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the
    wrist. Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the
    same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the
    girl's eyes were. They were probably brown, but people with dark hair
    sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would have
    been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among
    the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead
    of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully
    at Winston out of nests of hair.




    Chapter 2



    Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade,
    stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under the
    trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air
    seemed to kiss one's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deeper
    in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring-doves.

    He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties about the journey, and
    the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he
    would normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe
    place. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the
    country than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, but there
    was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might
    be picked up and recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey
    by yourself without attracting attention. For distances of less than
    100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but
    sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who
    examined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkward
    questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the
    station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not
    being followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of
    the summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was
    filled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothless
    great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon
    with 'in-laws' in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston,
    to get hold of a little black-market butter.

    The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him
    of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch,
    but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot
    that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began
    picking some partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that
    he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they
    met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly
    scent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a
    foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best thing to do.
    It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To look
    round was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell
    lightly on his shoulder.

    He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning
    that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the way
    along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way
    before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed,
    still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but as
    he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet
    sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the
    sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite
    likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back
    after all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted
    him. Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him
    feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of
    London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had
    probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to the
    fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apart
    the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston
    followed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy
    knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. The girl
    stopped and turned.

    'Here we are,' she said.

    He was facing her at several paces' distance. As yet he did not dare move
    nearer to her.

    'I didn't want to say anything in the lane,' she went on, 'in case there's
    a mike hidden there. I don't suppose there is, but there could be. There's
    always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. We're all
    right here.'

    He still had not the courage to approach her. 'We're all right here?'
    he repeated stupidly.

    'Yes. Look at the trees.' They were small ashes, which at some time had
    been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles, none of
    them thicker than one's wrist. 'There's nothing big enough to hide a mike
    in. Besides, I've been here before.'

    They were only making conversation. He had managed to move closer to her
    now. She stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face that
    looked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slow
    to act. The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to have
    fallen of their own accord. He took her hand.

    'Would you believe,' he said, 'that till this moment I didn't know what
    colour your eyes were?' They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of
    brown, with dark lashes. 'Now that you've seen what I'm really like,
    can you still bear to look at me?'

    'Yes, easily.'

    'I'm thirty-nine years old. I've got a wife that I can't get rid of. I've
    got varicose veins. I've got five false teeth.'

    'I couldn't care less,' said the girl.

    The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his arms.
    At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthful
    body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his
    face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the
    wide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling
    him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down on to the
    ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her.
    But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere
    contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was
    happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and
    prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without
    women--he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled a
    bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round his
    waist.

    'Never mind, dear. There's no hurry. We've got the whole afternoon. Isn't
    this a splendid hide-out? I found it when I got lost once on a community
    hike. If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away.'

    'What is your name?' said Winston.

    'Julia. I know yours. It's Winston--Winston Smith.'

    'How did you find that out?'

    'I expect I'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. Tell me,
    what did you think of me before that day I gave you the note?'

    He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was even a sort of
    love-offering to start off by telling the worst.

    'I hated the sight of you,' he said. 'I wanted to rape you and then murder
    you afterwards. Two weeks ago I thought seriously of smashing your head in
    with a cobblestone. If you really want to know, I imagined that you had
    something to do with the Thought Police.'

    The girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as a
    tribute to the excellence of her disguise.

    'Not the Thought Police! You didn't honestly think that?'

    'Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your general appearance--merely
    because you're young and fresh and healthy, you understand--I thought that
    probably----'

    'You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word and deed. Banners,
    processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuff. And you
    thought that if I had a quarter of a chance I'd denounce you as a
    thought-criminal and get you killed off?'

    'Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are like that,
    you know.'

    'It's this bloody thing that does it,' she said, ripping off the scarlet
    sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging it on to a bough. Then,
    as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in
    the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She
    broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he had
    taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. It was
    dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. Chocolate normally was
    dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it,
    like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted
    chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scent
    had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was
    powerful and troubling.

    'Where did you get this stuff?' he said.

    'Black market,' she said indifferently. 'Actually I am that sort of girl,
    to look at. I'm good at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I do
    voluntary work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours
    and hours I've spent pasting their bloody rot all over London. I always
    carry one end of a banner in the processions. I always look cheerful and
    I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that's what I say.
    It's the only way to be safe.'

    The first fragment of chocolate had melted on Winston's tongue. The taste
    was delightful. But there was still that memory moving round the edges of
    his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite
    shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. He pushed it
    away from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action which he
    would have liked to undo but could not.

    'You are very young,' he said. 'You are ten or fifteen years younger than
    I am. What could you see to attract you in a man like me?'

    'It was something in your face. I thought I'd take a chance. I'm good at
    spotting people who don't belong. As soon as I saw you I knew you were
    against THEM.'

    THEM, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner Party, about
    whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy,
    although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere.
    A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language.
    Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom
    did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention
    the Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words
    that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It
    was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways,
    and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that
    smells bad hay. They had left the clearing and were wandering again
    through the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waists
    whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how much
    softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not
    speak above a whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better to
    go quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. She
    stopped him.

    'Don't go out into the open. There might be someone watching. We're all
    right if we keep behind the boughs.'

    They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sunlight, filtering
    through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. Winston looked
    out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of
    recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, close-bitten pasture, with a
    footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged
    hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just
    perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense
    masses like women's hair. Surely somewhere nearby, but out of sight,
    there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming?

    'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.

    'That's right, there is a stream. It's at the edge of the next field,
    actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You can watch them lying
    in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails.'

    'It's the Golden Country--almost,' he murmured.

    'The Golden Country?'

    'It's nothing, really. A landscape I've seen sometimes in a dream.'

    'Look!' whispered Julia.

    A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the level
    of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in
    the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place
    again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance
    to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the
    afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung
    together, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with
    astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the
    bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped
    for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its
    speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort
    of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate,
    no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood
    and pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there
    was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in
    low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would
    pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small,
    beetle-like man was listening intently--listening to that. But by degrees
    the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as
    though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got
    mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped
    thinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft
    and warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body
    seemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as
    water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard
    kisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart again
    both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright and fled with a clatter
    of wings.

    Winston put his lips against her ear. 'NOW,' he whispered.

    'Not here,' she whispered back. 'Come back to the hide-out. It's safer.'

    Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way back
    to the clearing. When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned
    and faced him. They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared
    round the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant,
    then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his
    dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes
    off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent
    gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body
    gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body;
    his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile.
    He knelt down before her and took her hands in his.

    'Have you done this before?'

    'Of course. Hundreds of times--well, scores of times, anyway.'

    'With Party members?'

    'Yes, always with Party members.'

    'With members of the Inner Party?'

    'Not with those swine, no. But there's plenty that WOULD if they got half
    a chance. They're not so holy as they make out.'

    His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been
    hundreds--thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him
    with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface,
    its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing
    iniquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or
    syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to
    undermine! He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face.

    'Listen. The more men you've had, the more I love you. Do you understand
    that?'

    'Yes, perfectly.'

    'I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere.
    I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones.'

    'Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I'm corrupt to the bones.'

    'You like doing this? I don't mean simply me: I mean the thing in itself?'

    'I adore it.'

    That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of one
    person but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that
    was the force that would tear the Party to pieces. He pressed her down
    upon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no
    difficulty. Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to
    normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The
    sun seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached out for
    the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her. Almost immediately
    they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour.

    Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freckled face, still
    peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. Except for her mouth,
    you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes,
    if you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and
    soft. It occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where
    she lived.

    The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying,
    protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under
    the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back.
    He pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the
    old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it was
    desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure
    love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was
    mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax
    a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.




    Chapter 3



    'We can come here once again,' said Julia. 'It's generally safe to use any
    hide-out twice. But not for another month or two, of course.'

    As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She became alert and
    business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her
    waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed
    natural to leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which
    Winston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the
    countryside round London, stored away from innumerable community hikes.
    The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had
    come, and brought him out at a different railway station. 'Never go home
    the same way as you went out,' she said, as though enunciating an important
    general principle. She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half an
    hour before following her.

    She had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings
    hence. It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an
    open market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging
    about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or
    sewing-thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow
    her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without
    recognition. But with luck, in the middle of the crowd, it would be
    safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting.

    'And now I must go,' she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions.
    'I'm due back at nineteen-thirty. I've got to put in two hours for the
    Junior Anti-Sex League, handing out leaflets, or something. Isn't it
    bloody? Give me a brush-down, would you? Have I got any twigs in my hair?
    Are you sure? Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!'

    She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a moment
    later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood
    with very little noise. Even now he had not found out her surname or her
    address. However, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that
    they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication.

    As it happened, they never went back to the clearing in the wood. During
    the month of May there was only one further occasion on which they actually
    succeeded in making love. That was in another hiding-place known to Julia,
    the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country
    where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good
    hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very
    dangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different
    place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the
    street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted
    down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one
    another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked
    on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence
    by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then
    taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly
    cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without
    introduction on the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this
    kind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'. She was
    also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in
    almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They
    were passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when
    they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the
    earth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his
    side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at
    hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his
    own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was
    dead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live
    warm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his
    lips. Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.

    There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to
    walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round
    the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. Even if it had been
    less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet.
    Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, and
    their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not
    often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.
    She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and
    demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior Anti-Sex League,
    preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings
    campaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it was camouflage.
    If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even induced
    Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for
    the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party
    members. So, one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of paralysing
    boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts
    of bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking of
    hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.

    When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary
    conversation were filled up. It was a blazing afternoon. The air in the
    little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt
    overpoweringly of pigeon dung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty,
    twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to
    cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming.

    Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with thirty other
    girls ('Always in the stink of women! How I hate women!' she said
    parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing
    machines in the Fiction Department. She enjoyed her work, which consisted
    chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor.
    She was 'not clever', but was fond of using her hands and felt at home
    with machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel,
    from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the
    final touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not interested in the
    finished product. She 'didn't much care for reading,' she said. Books were
    just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.

    She had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only
    person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the
    Revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. At
    school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics
    trophy two years running. She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and a
    branch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti-Sex
    League. She had always borne an excellent character. She had even (an
    infallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec,
    the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap
    pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House
    by the people who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for
    a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like
    'Spanking Stories' or 'One Night in a Girls' School', to be bought
    furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they
    were buying something illegal.

    'What are these books like?' said Winston curiously.

    'Oh, ghastly rubbish. They're boring, really. They only have six plots,
    but they swap them round a bit. Of course I was only on the kaleidoscopes.
    I was never in the Rewrite Squad. I'm not literary, dear--not even enough
    for that.'

    He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Pornosec, except the
    heads of the departments, were girls. The theory was that men, whose sex
    instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greater
    danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.

    'They don't even like having married women there,' she added. Girls are
    always supposed to be so pure. Here's one who isn't, anyway.

    She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a Party member
    of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. 'And a good job too,'
    said Julia, 'otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he
    confessed.' Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw it
    was quite simple. You wanted a good time; 'they', meaning the Party,
    wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. She
    seemed to think it just as natural that 'they' should want to rob you of
    your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. She hated
    the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general
    criticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had no
    interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak words
    except the ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard of
    the Brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. Any kind of
    organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure,
    struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stay
    alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many others like her there
    might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of
    the Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as something
    unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply
    evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.

    They did not discuss the possibility of getting married. It was too remote
    to be worth thinking about. No imaginable committee would ever sanction
    such a marriage even if Katharine, Winston's wife, could somehow have been
    got rid of. It was hopeless even as a daydream.

    'What was she like, your wife?' said Julia.

    'She was--do you know the Newspeak word GOODTHINKFUL? Meaning naturally
    orthodox, incapable of thinking a bad thought?'

    'No, I didn't know the word, but I know the kind of person, right enough.'

    He began telling her the story of his married life, but curiously enough
    she appeared to know the essential parts of it already. She described
    to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of
    Katharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she still
    seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength, even when her
    arms were clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt no difficulty in
    talking about such things: Katharine, in any case, had long ceased to be
    a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one.

    'I could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing,' he said. He told
    her about the frigid little ceremony that Katharine had forced him to go
    through on the same night every week. 'She hated it, but nothing would
    make her stop doing it. She used to call it--but you'll never guess.'

    'Our duty to the Party,' said Julia promptly.

    'How did you know that?'

    'I've been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for the
    over-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement. They rub it into you for years.
    I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But of course you can never tell;
    people are such hypocrites.'

    She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, everything came back
    to her own sexuality. As soon as this was touched upon in any way she was
    capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner
    meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex
    instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control
    and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more
    important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable
    because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way
    she put it was:

    'When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy
    and don't give a damn for anything. They can't bear you to feel like that.
    They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching
    up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If
    you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother
    and the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of
    their bloody rot?'

    That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connexion
    between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the
    hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be
    kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct
    and using it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the
    Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similar
    trick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually be
    abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their
    children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand,
    were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them
    and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension
    of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be
    surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.

    Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine would unquestionably
    have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be too
    stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled
    her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which
    had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia of
    something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another
    sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.

    It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost their
    way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged behind
    the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and
    presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk
    quarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at the
    bottom. There was nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she
    realized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy. To be away
    from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of
    wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start
    searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed some
    tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them.
    One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on
    the same root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called
    to Katharine to come and look at it.

    'Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump down near the bottom.
    Do you see they're two different colours?'

    She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back for
    a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was
    pointing. He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on
    her waist to steady her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how
    completely alone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, not a
    leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like this the danger that
    there would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was a
    microphone it would only pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour
    of the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his
    face. And the thought struck him...

    'Why didn't you give her a good shove?' said Julia. 'I would have.'

    'Yes, dear, you would have. I would, if I'd been the same person then as
    I am now. Or perhaps I would--I'm not certain.'

    'Are you sorry you didn't?'

    'Yes. On the whole I'm sorry I didn't.'

    They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. He pulled her closer
    against him. Her head rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell of her
    hair conquering the pigeon dung. She was very young, he thought, she
    still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push
    an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing.

    'Actually it would have made no difference,' he said.

    'Then why are you sorry you didn't do it?'

    'Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we're
    playing, we can't win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds,
    that's all.'

    He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradicted
    him when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it as a law
    of nature that the individual is always defeated. In a way she realized
    that she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would
    catch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believed
    that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could
    live as you chose. All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. She
    did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the
    only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from
    the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself
    as a corpse.

    'We are the dead,' he said.

    'We're not dead yet,' said Julia prosaically.

    'Not physically. Six months, a year--five years, conceivably. I am afraid
    of death. You are young, so presumably you're more afraid of it than I am.
    Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. But it makes very little
    difference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the
    same thing.'

    'Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? Don't
    you enjoy being alive? Don't you like feeling: This is me, this is my hand,
    this is my leg, I'm real, I'm solid, I'm alive! Don't you like THIS?'

    She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him. He could feel
    her breasts, ripe yet firm, through her overalls. Her body seemed to be
    pouring some of its youth and vigour into his.

    'Yes, I like that,' he said.

    'Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear, we've got to fix
    up about the next time we meet. We may as well go back to the place in
    the wood. We've given it a good long rest. But you must get there by a
    different way this time. I've got it all planned out. You take the
    train--but look, I'll draw it out for you.'

    And in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust,
    and with a twig from a pigeon's nest began drawing a map on the floor.




    Chapter 4



    Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's shop.
    Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and
    a coverless bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was
    ticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, the
    glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out
    of the half-darkness.

    In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups,
    provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water
    to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some
    saccharine tablets. The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was
    nineteen-twenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.

    Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly.
    Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit, this one was the least
    possible to conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his head in
    the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface
    of the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made no
    difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollars
    that it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively
    knowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose
    of a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in
    generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he
    had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing.
    Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. And when
    they had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew
    of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to fade
    out of existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to the
    house, one of them through the back yard, which gave on an alley.

    Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped out, secure in the
    protection of the muslin curtain. The June sun was still high in the sky,
    and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman
    pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her
    middle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line,
    pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized as
    babies' diapers. Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she
    was singing in a powerful contralto:


    It was only an 'opeless fancy.
    It passed like an Ipril dye,
    But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred!
    They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!


    The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It was one of countless
    similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub-section of
    the Music Department. The words of these songs were composed without any
    human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator.
    But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an
    almost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of
    her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street,
    and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the
    room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen.

    Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable that they could
    frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. But
    the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors
    and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time
    after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange
    meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of
    Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex
    preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody.
    Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day.
    They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening
    beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked
    at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from the
    short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.

    'It's all off,' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak.
    'Tomorrow, I mean.'

    'What?'

    'Tomorrow afternoon. I can't come.'

    'Why not?'

    'Oh, the usual reason. It's started early this time.'

    For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had known
    her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning there
    had been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had been
    simply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The
    smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed
    to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a
    physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he
    had a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling
    that she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed
    them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of his
    fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It
    struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment
    must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had
    not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they
    were a married couple of ten years' standing. He wished that he were
    walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly
    and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the
    household. He wished above all that they had some place where they could
    be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time
    they met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the
    following day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had occurred
    to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected
    readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were
    intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the
    edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
    It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's
    consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as
    surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps
    postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful
    act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.

    At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into the
    room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had
    sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward
    to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly,
    partly because she was still holding the tool-bag.

    'Half a second,' she said. 'Just let me show you what I've brought. Did
    you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? I thought you would. You
    can chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. Look here.'

    She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spanners
    and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. Underneath were a number
    of neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston had a
    strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of
    heavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it.

    'It isn't sugar?' he said.

    'Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here's a loaf of bread--proper
    white bread, not our bloody stuff--and a little pot of jam. And here's a
    tin of milk--but look! This is the one I'm really proud of. I had to wrap
    a bit of sacking round it, because----'

    But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. The smell was
    already filling the room, a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation
    from his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with even
    now, blowing down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusing itself
    mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lost
    again.

    'It's coffee,' he murmured, 'real coffee.'

    'It's Inner Party coffee. There's a whole kilo here,' she said.

    'How did you manage to get hold of all these things?'

    'It's all Inner Party stuff. There's nothing those swine don't have,
    nothing. But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things,
    and--look, I got a little packet of tea as well.'

    Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a corner of the packet.

    'It's real tea. Not blackberry leaves.'

    'There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured India, or
    something,' she said vaguely. 'But listen, dear. I want you to turn your
    back on me for three minutes. Go and sit on the other side of the bed.
    Don't go too near the window. And don't turn round till I tell you.'

    Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. Down in the yard
    the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and
    the line. She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep
    feeling:


    They sye that time 'eals all things,
    They sye you can always forget;
    But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years
    They twist my 'eart-strings yet!


    She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. Her voice floated
    upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort of
    happy melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly
    content, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes
    inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers
    and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he had never
    heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even
    have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to
    oneself. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation
    level that they had anything to sing about.

    'You can turn round now,' said Julia.

    He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What he
    had actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not naked. The
    transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. She
    had painted her face.

    She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought
    herself a complete set of make-up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened,
    her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something
    under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but
    Winston's standards in such matters were not high. He had never before
    seen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The
    improvement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour
    in the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above
    all, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added
    to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets
    flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness of a basement
    kitchen, and a woman's cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that
    she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.

    'Scent too!' he said.

    'Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I'm going to do next? I'm
    going to get hold of a real woman's frock from somewhere and wear it
    instead of these bloody trousers. I'll wear silk stockings and high-heeled
    shoes! In this room I'm going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.'

    They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. It
    was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence.
    Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with
    the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch
    over his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was
    threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonished
    both of them. 'It's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?' said Julia.
    One never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles.
    Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia had never been
    in one before, so far as she could remember.

    Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up the
    hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, because
    Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her
    make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light
    stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray
    from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the
    fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard
    the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in
    from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had
    been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer
    evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose,
    talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply
    lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could
    never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed
    her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.

    'Half that water's boiled away,' she said. 'I'll get up and make some
    coffee in another moment. We've got an hour. What time do they cut the
    lights off at your flats?'

    'Twenty-three thirty.'

    'It's twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that,
    because--Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!'

    She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor,
    and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly
    as he had seen her fling the dictionary at Goldstein, that morning during
    the Two Minutes Hate.

    'What was it?' he said in surprise.

    'A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. There's a
    hole down there. I gave him a good fright, anyway.'

    'Rats!' murmured Winston. 'In this room!'

    'They're all over the place,' said Julia indifferently as she lay down
    again. 'We've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. Some parts of
    London are swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? Yes,
    they do. In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for
    two minutes. It's the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nasty
    thing is that the brutes always----'

    'DON'T GO ON!' said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut.

    'Dearest! You've gone quite pale. What's the matter? Do they make you feel
    sick?'

    'Of all horrors in the world--a rat!'

    She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though
    to reassure him with the warmth of her body. He did not reopen his eyes
    immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a
    nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was
    always very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness,
    and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too
    dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of
    self-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of
    darkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own
    brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He always woke
    up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with what
    Julia had been saying when he cut her short.

    'I'm sorry,' he said, 'it's nothing. I don't like rats, that's all.'

    'Don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here.
    I'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. And next time we
    come here I'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly.'

    Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feeling slightly
    ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed,
    pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from the
    saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest
    anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was even
    better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by
    the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine.
    With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other,
    Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase,
    pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself
    down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining
    the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She brought
    the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better
    light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft,
    rainwatery appearance of the glass.

    'What is it, do you think?' said Julia.

    'I don't think it's anything--I mean, I don't think it was ever put to any
    use. That's what I like about it. It's a little chunk of history that
    they've forgotten to alter. It's a message from a hundred years ago, if
    one knew how to read it.'

    'And that picture over there'--she nodded at the engraving on the opposite
    wall--'would that be a hundred years old?'

    'More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can't tell. It's impossible to discover
    the age of anything nowadays.'

    She went over to look at it. 'Here's where that brute stuck his nose out,'
    she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture. 'What is
    this place? I've seen it before somewhere.'

    'It's a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes its name was.'
    The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught him came back into
    his head, and he added half-nostalgically: "Oranges and lemons, say the
    bells of St Clement's!"

    To his astonishment she capped the line:


    'You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,
    When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey----'


    'I can't remember how it goes on after that. But anyway I remember it ends
    up, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop
    off your head!"'

    It was like the two halves of a countersign. But there must be another
    line after 'the bells of Old Bailey'. Perhaps it could be dug out of
    Mr Charrington's memory, if he were suitably prompted.

    'Who taught you that?' he said.

    'My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little girl. He was
    vaporized when I was eight--at any rate, he disappeared. I wonder what a
    lemon was,' she added inconsequently. 'I've seen oranges. They're a kind
    of round yellow fruit with a thick skin.'

    'I can remember lemons,' said Winston. 'They were quite common in the
    fifties. They were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell
    them.'

    'I bet that picture's got bugs behind it,' said Julia. 'I'll take it down
    and give it a good clean some day. I suppose it's almost time we were
    leaving. I must start washing this paint off. What a bore! I'll get the
    lipstick off your face afterwards.'

    Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The room was darkening. He
    turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight.
    The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the
    interior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it was
    almost as transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass
    had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere
    complete. He had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in
    fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table,
    and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. The
    paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia's life and his
    own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.




    Chapter 5



    Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing from work: a few
    thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobody
    mentioned him. On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of the
    Records Department to look at the notice-board. One of the notices carried
    a printed list of the members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had
    been one. It looked almost exactly as it had looked before--nothing had
    been crossed out--but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme had
    ceased to exist: he had never existed.

    The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless,
    air-conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature, but outside the
    pavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours
    was a horror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and the
    staffs of all the Ministries were working overtime. Processions, meetings,
    military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays, film shows, telescreen
    programmes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies
    built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs
    faked. Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had been taken off the
    production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets.
    Winston, in addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day in
    going through back files of 'The Times' and altering and embellishing news
    items which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at night, when crowds of
    rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. The
    rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance
    there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which
    there were wild rumours.

    The new tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate Week (the Hate Song,
    it was called) had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged
    on the telescreens. It had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly
    be called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared out by
    hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. The
    proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competed
    with the still-popular 'It was only a hopeless fancy'. The Parsons children
    played it at all hours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and a
    piece of toilet paper. Winston's evenings were fuller than ever. Squads of
    volunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for Hate Week,
    stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and
    perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers.
    Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display four hundred
    metres of bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as a lark.
    The heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting
    to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings. He was everywhere at once,
    pushing, pulling, sawing, hammering, improvising, jollying everyone along
    with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what
    seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat.

    A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It had no caption,
    and represented simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier, three
    or four metres high, striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face
    and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whatever
    angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by the
    foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. The thing had been
    plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the
    portraits of Big Brother. The proles, normally apathetic about the war,
    were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism.
    As though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been
    killing larger numbers of people than usual. One fell on a crowded film
    theatre in Stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. The
    whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailing
    funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting.
    Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground
    and several dozen children were blown to pieces. There were further angry
    demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the
    poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and
    a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round
    that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and
    an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their
    house set on fire and perished of suffocation.

    In the room over Mr Charrington's shop, when they could get there, Julia
    and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window,
    naked for the sake of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the bugs
    had multiplied hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or
    clean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle
    everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes,
    and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that
    the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack.

    Four, five, six--seven times they met during the month of June. Winston
    had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost
    the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided,
    leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of
    coughing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased
    to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the
    telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. Now that they had a
    secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship that
    they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time.
    What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. To know
    that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The room
    was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk.
    Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usually
    stopped to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs.
    The old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other
    hand to have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence between the
    tiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his
    meals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient
    gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity to
    talk. Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and
    thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had
    always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman.
    With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or
    that--a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, a
    pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby's hair--never
    asking that Winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. To
    talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box.
    He had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of
    forgotten rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and
    another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death
    of poor Cock Robin. 'It just occurred to me you might be interested,' he
    would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new
    fragment. But he could never recall more than a few lines of any one
    rhyme.

    Both of them knew--in a way, it was never out of their minds that what
    was now happening could not last long. There were times when the fact of
    impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would
    cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul
    grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five
    minutes of striking. But there were also times when they had the illusion
    not only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually in
    this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there was
    difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when
    Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that
    it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside
    it time could be arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of
    escape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their
    intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. Or
    Katharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and Julia would
    succeed in getting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Or
    they would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speak
    with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live out their lives
    undetected in a back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In
    reality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was practicable,
    suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to day
    and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed
    an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next
    breath so long as there is air available.

    Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the
    Party, but with no notion of how to take the first step. Even if the
    fabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty
    of finding one's way into it. He told her of the strange intimacy that
    existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of the
    impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien's presence, announce
    that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough,
    this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to
    judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston
    should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash
    of the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly
    everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought
    it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized
    opposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and his
    underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party
    had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe
    in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations,
    she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose
    names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the
    faintest belief. When public trials were happening she had taken her place
    in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from
    morning to night, chanting at intervals 'Death to the traitors!' During
    the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults
    at Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and
    what doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up since the
    Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the
    fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an independent political movement was
    outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. It
    would always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel
    against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of
    violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.

    In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible
    to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mention
    the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her
    opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on
    London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, 'just to
    keep people frightened'. This was an idea that had literally never occurred
    to him. She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during
    the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out
    laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they
    in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept
    the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and
    falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having
    learnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own
    schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the
    helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later,
    when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one
    generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he
    told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long
    before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. After
    all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more
    of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did
    not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia
    and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as
    a sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy
    had changed. 'I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia,' she said
    vaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated
    from long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happened
    only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her about
    it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing
    her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and
    not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as
    unimportant. 'Who cares?' she said impatiently. 'It's always one bloody
    war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway.'

    Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent
    forgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to horrify
    her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought
    of lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and
    Rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between
    his fingers. It did not make much impression on her. At first, indeed, she
    failed to grasp the point of the story.

    'Were they friends of yours?' she said.

    'No, I never knew them. They were Inner Party members. Besides, they were
    far older men than I was. They belonged to the old days, before the
    Revolution. I barely knew them by sight.'

    'Then what was there to worry about? People are being killed off all the
    time, aren't they?'

    He tried to make her understand. 'This was an exceptional case. It wasn't
    just a question of somebody being killed. Do you realize that the past,
    starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives
    anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like
    that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about
    the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been
    destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has
    been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed,
    every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and
    minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless
    present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the
    past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even
    when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence
    ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know
    with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Just in
    that one instance, in my whole life, I did possess actual concrete evidence
    after the event--years after it.'

    'And what good was that?'

    'It was no good, because I threw it away a few minutes later. But if the
    same thing happened today, I should keep it.'

    'Well, I wouldn't!' said Julia. 'I'm quite ready to take risks, but only
    for something worth while, not for bits of old newspaper. What could you
    have done with it even if you had kept it?'

    'Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might have planted a few doubts
    here and there, supposing that I'd dared to show it to anybody. I don't
    imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imagine
    little knots of resistance springing up here and there--small groups of
    people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leaving
    a few records behind, so that the next generations can carry on where we
    leave off.'

    'I'm not interested in the next generation, dear. I'm interested in US.'

    'You're only a rebel from the waist downwards,' he told her.

    She thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight.

    In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest.
    Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc, doublethink, the
    mutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to use
    Newspeak words, she became bored and confused and said that she never paid
    any attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was all rubbish, so
    why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when to cheer and when to boo,
    and that was all one needed. If he persisted in talking of such subjects,
    she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep. She was one of those
    people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking to her,
    he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while
    having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. In a way, the world-view
    of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of
    understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations
    of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was
    demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to
    notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane.
    They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm,
    because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass
    undigested through the body of a bird.




    Chapter 6



    It had happened at last. The expected message had come. All his life, it
    seemed to him, he had been waiting for this to happen.

    He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almost
    at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became
    aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. The
    person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to
    speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned. It was O'Brien.

    At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was
    to run away. His heart bounded violently. He would have been incapable of
    speaking. O'Brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement,
    laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston's arm, so that the two of
    them were walking side by side. He began speaking with the peculiar grave
    courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members.

    'I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,' he said. 'I was
    reading one of your Newspeak articles in 'The Times' the other day. You
    take a scholarly interest in Newspeak, I believe?'

    Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. 'Hardly scholarly,' he
    said. 'I'm only an amateur. It's not my subject. I have never had anything
    to do with the actual construction of the language.'

    'But you write it very elegantly,' said O'Brien. 'That is not only my own
    opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an
    expert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment.'

    Again Winston's heart stirred painfully. It was inconceivable that this
    was anything other than a reference to Syme. But Syme was not only dead,
    he was abolished, an unperson. Any identifiable reference to him would have
    been mortally dangerous. O'Brien's remark must obviously have been intended
    as a signal, a codeword. By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had
    turned the two of them into accomplices. They had continued to stroll
    slowly down the corridor, but now O'Brien halted. With the curious,
    disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he
    resettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he went on:

    'What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed you
    had used two words which have become obsolete. But they have only become
    so very recently. Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak
    Dictionary?'

    'No,' said Winston. 'I didn't think it had been issued yet. We are still
    using the ninth in the Records Department.'

    'The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, I believe. But a
    few advance copies have been circulated. I have one myself. It might
    interest you to look at it, perhaps?'

    'Very much so,' said Winston, immediately seeing where this tended.

    'Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The reduction in the
    number of verbs--that is the point that will appeal to you, I think. Let
    me see, shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary? But I am
    afraid I invariably forget anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick
    it up at my flat at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give you my
    address.'

    They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat absent-mindedly
    O'Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered
    notebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in
    such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the
    instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore
    out the page and handed it to Winston.

    'I am usually at home in the evenings,' he said. 'If not, my servant will
    give you the dictionary.'

    He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time
    there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was
    written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along
    with a mass of other papers.

    They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most.
    There was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have. It had
    been contrived as a way of letting Winston know O'Brien's address. This
    was necessary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to
    discover where anyone lived. There were no directories of any kind. 'If
    you ever want to see me, this is where I can be found,' was what O'Brien
    had been saying to him. Perhaps there would even be a message concealed
    somewhere in the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. The
    conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer
    edges of it.

    He knew that sooner or later he would obey O'Brien's summons. Perhaps
    tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay--he was not certain. What was
    happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years
    ago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second
    had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words,
    and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would
    happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained
    in the beginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was like
    a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even while he was
    speaking to O'Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly
    shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. He had the sensation
    of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better
    because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.




    Chapter 7



    Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Julia rolled sleepily
    against him, murmuring something that might have been 'What's the matter?'

    'I dreamt--' he began, and stopped short. It was too complex to be put
    into words. There was the dream itself, and there was a memory connected
    with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking.

    He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of the
    dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to
    stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain.
    It had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the
    glass was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was flooded
    with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances.
    The dream had also been comprehended by--indeed, in some sense it had
    consisted in--a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again
    thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film,
    trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopter
    blew them both to pieces.

    'Do you know,' he said, 'that until this moment I believed I had murdered
    my mother?'

    'Why did you murder her?' said Julia, almost asleep.

    'I didn't murder her. Not physically.'

    In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother, and within
    a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all
    come back. It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of
    his consciousness over many years. He was not certain of the date, but he
    could not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had
    happened.

    His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier he could
    not remember. He remembered better the rackety, uneasy circumstances of
    the time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube
    stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations
    posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same
    colour, the enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittent
    machine-gun fire in the distance--above all, the fact that there was
    never enough to eat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys
    in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs of
    cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust
    from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting
    for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were
    known to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted over the bad
    patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.

    When his father disappeared, his mother did not show any surprise or any
    violent grief, but a sudden change came over her. She seemed to have
    become completely spiritless. It was evident even to Winston that she was
    waiting for something that she knew must happen. She did everything that
    was needed--cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted
    the mantelpiece--always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous
    motion, like an artist's lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her large
    shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours at a
    time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister,
    a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made simian
    by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms and
    press him against her for a long time without saying anything. He was
    aware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehow
    connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen.

    He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling room that
    seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. There was a gas ring
    in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside
    there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He remembered
    his mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something
    in a saucepan. Above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the
    fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly,
    over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm
    at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to
    break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would
    attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his
    share. His mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. She
    took it for granted that he, 'the boy', should have the biggest portion;
    but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. At every meal
    she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little
    sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would cry out
    with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan
    and spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister's plate.
    He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he
    even felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his belly
    seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard,
    he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf.

    One day a chocolate ration was issued. There had been no such issue for
    weeks or months past. He remembered quite clearly that precious little
    morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about
    ounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that it
    ought to be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were
    listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding in a loud
    booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother told him
    not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went round and
    round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny
    sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey,
    sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the
    end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to
    Winston, giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold
    of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winston
    stood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had
    snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeing
    for the door.

    'Winston, Winston!' his mother called after him. 'Come back! Give your
    sister back her chocolate!'

    He stopped, but did not come back. His mother's anxious eyes were fixed on
    his face. Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what
    it was that was on the point of happening. His sister, conscious of having
    been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother drew her
    arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. Something in
    the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned and fled down
    the stairs, with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand.

    He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured the chocolate he felt
    somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several
    hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother had
    disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing was
    gone from the room except his mother and his sister. They had not taken
    any clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. To this day he did not know
    with any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible
    that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his sister,
    she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the colonies
    for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which had
    grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the
    labour camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or other
    to die.

    The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting
    gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. His
    mind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother
    had sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so
    she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper
    every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water.

    He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance. Without opening her
    eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position.

    'I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,' she said
    indistinctly. 'All children are swine.'

    'Yes. But the real point of the story----'

    From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again.
    He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did not
    suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual
    woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of
    nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed
    were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered
    from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is
    ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved
    him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. When
    the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in
    her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more
    chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemed
    natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered
    the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bullets
    than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done was to
    persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while
    at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When
    once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel,
    what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference.
    Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever
    heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream of history. And
    yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed
    all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They
    were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What
    mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture,
    an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in
    itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this
    condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they
    were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not
    despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would
    one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed
    human. They had not become hardened inside. They had held on to the
    primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort.
    And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few
    weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked
    it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.

    'The proles are human beings,' he said aloud. 'We are not human.'

    'Why not?' said Julia, who had woken up again.

    He thought for a little while. 'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said,
    'that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here
    before it's too late, and never see each other again?'

    'Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I'm not going to do
    it, all the same.'

    'We've been lucky,' he said 'but it can't last much longer. You're young.
    You look normal and innocent. If you keep clear of people like me, you
    might stay alive for another fifty years.'

    'No. I've thought it all out. What you do, I'm going to do. And don't be
    too downhearted. I'm rather good at staying alive.'

    'We may be together for another six months--a year--there's no knowing.
    At the end we're certain to be apart. Do you realize how utterly alone we
    shall be? When once they get hold of us there will be nothing, literally
    nothing, that either of us can do for the other. If I confess, they'll
    shoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they'll shoot you just the same.
    Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will put off
    your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us will even know
    whether the other is alive or dead. We shall be utterly without power of
    any kind. The one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray one
    another, although even that can't make the slightest difference.'

    'If you mean confessing,' she said, 'we shall do that, right enough.
    Everybody always confesses. You can't help it. They torture you.'

    'I don't mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do
    doesn't matter: only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving
    you--that would be the real betrayal.'

    She thought it over. 'They can't do that,' she said finally. 'It's the one
    thing they can't do. They can make you say anything--ANYTHING--but they
    can't make you believe it. They can't get inside you.'

    'No,' he said a little more hopefully, 'no; that's quite true. They can't
    get inside you. If you can FEEL that staying human is worth while, even
    when it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them.'

    He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. They could spy
    upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwit
    them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of
    finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less
    true when you were actually in their hands. One did not know what happened
    inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs,
    delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions, gradual
    wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning.
    Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down
    by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the object
    was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately
    make? They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not
    alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the
    utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the
    inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained
    impregnable.




    Chapter 8



    They had done it, they had done it at last!

    The room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit. The
    telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpet
    gave one the impression of treading on velvet. At the far end of the room
    O'Brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of
    papers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look up when the
    servant showed Julia and Winston in.

    Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be
    able to speak. They had done it, they had done it at last, was all he
    could think. It had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer folly
    to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different
    routes and only met on O'Brien's doorstep. But merely to walk into such a
    place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on very rare occasions
    that one saw inside the dwelling-places of the Inner Party, or even
    penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived. The whole
    atmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of
    everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the
    silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed
    servants hurrying to and fro--everything was intimidating. Although he had
    a good pretext for coming here, he was haunted at every step by the fear
    that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner,
    demand his papers, and order him to get out. O'Brien's servant, however,
    had admitted the two of them without demur. He was a small, dark-haired
    man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless
    face which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which he
    led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white
    wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That too was intimidating. Winston
    could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not
    grimy from the contact of human bodies.

    O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying
    it intently. His heavy face, bent down so that one could see the line of
    the nose, looked both formidable and intelligent. For perhaps twenty
    seconds he sat without stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite towards
    him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries:

    'Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion
    contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop
    unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery
    overheads stop end message.'

    He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the
    soundless carpet. A little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen
    away from him with the Newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than
    usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that
    Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary
    embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a
    stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was any
    kind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single
    equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on
    a dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to
    borrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossible
    to explain. As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike
    him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There was
    a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.

    Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even in the midst
    of his panic, Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his
    tongue.

    'You can turn it off!' he said.

    'Yes,' said O'Brien, 'we can turn it off. We have that privilege.'

    He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them,
    and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was waiting,
    somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it was
    quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he
    had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen
    the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With
    difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then
    suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings
    of a smile. With his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettled his
    spectacles on his nose.

    'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.

    'I will say it,' said Winston promptly. 'That thing is really turned off?'

    'Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.'

    'We have come here because----'

    He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of
    his own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind of
    help he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why he
    had come here. He went on, conscious that what he was saying
    must sound both feeble and pretentious:

    'We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secret
    organization working against the Party, and that you are involved in it.
    We want to join it and work for it. We are enemies of the Party. We
    disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are
    also adulterers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your
    mercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way, we are
    ready.'

    He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door
    had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come in
    without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter
    and glasses.

    'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively. 'Bring the drinks over
    here, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have we enough chairs? Then
    we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself,
    Martin. This is business. You can stop being a servant for the next ten
    minutes.'

    The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a
    servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Winston
    regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man's
    whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to
    drop his assumed personality even for a moment. O'Brien took the decanter
    by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused
    in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a
    hoarding--a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move
    up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top the
    stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby.
    It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at
    it with frank curiosity.

    'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile. 'You will have read
    about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party, I am
    afraid.' His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'I think it
    is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To
    Emmanuel Goldstein.'

    Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine was a thing he
    had read and dreamed about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington's
    half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the
    olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason
    he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like
    that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. Actually,
    when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. The
    truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it. He
    set down the empty glass.

    'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.

    'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do not know.'

    'And the conspiracy--the organization? Is it real? It is not simply an
    invention of the Thought Police?'

    'No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never learn much
    more about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it.
    I will come back to that presently.' He looked at his wrist-watch. 'It is
    unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for
    more than half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and
    you will have to leave separately. You, comrade'--he bowed his head to
    Julia--'will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.
    You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions.
    In general terms, what are you prepared to do?'

    'Anything that we are capable of,' said Winston.

    O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing
    Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted that
    Winston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down over his
    eyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as
    though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers
    were known to him already.

    'You are prepared to give your lives?'

    'Yes.'

    'You are prepared to commit murder?'

    'Yes.'

    'To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of
    innocent people?'

    'Yes.'

    'To betray your country to foreign powers?'

    'Yes.'

    'You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the minds
    of children, to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage prostitution,
    to disseminate venereal diseases--to do anything which is likely to cause
    demoralization and weaken the power of the Party?'

    'Yes.'

    'If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric
    acid in a child's face--are you prepared to do that?'

    'Yes.'

    'You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life
    as a waiter or a dock-worker?'

    'Yes.'

    'You are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?'

    'Yes.'

    'You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another
    again?'

    'No!' broke in Julia.

    It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered. For a
    moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. His
    tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word,
    then of the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he did not
    know which word he was going to say. 'No,' he said finally.

    'You did well to tell me,' said O'Brien. 'It is necessary for us to know
    everything.'

    He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more
    expression in it:

    'Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different
    person? We may be obliged to give him a new identity. His face, his
    movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair--even his voice
    would be different. And you yourself might have become a different person.
    Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it is
    necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.'

    Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's
    Mongolian face. There were no scars that he could see. Julia had turned a
    shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brien
    boldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent.

    'Good. Then that is settled.'

    There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather
    absent-minded air O'Brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself,
    then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think
    better standing. They were very good cigarettes, very thick and
    well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O'Brien looked at
    his wrist-watch again.

    'You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,' he said. 'I shall switch
    on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look at these comrades' faces
    before you go. You will be seeing them again. I may not.'

    Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes
    flickered over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in his
    manner. He was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in
    them, or appeared to feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic
    face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without speaking
    or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the door
    silently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the
    pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette.

    'You understand,' he said, 'that you will be fighting in the dark. You
    will always be in the dark. You will receive orders and you will obey them,
    without knowing why. Later I shall send you a book from which you will
    learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which
    we shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you will be full members
    of the Brotherhood. But between the general aims that we are fighting for
    and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. I
    tell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it
    numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal knowledge
    you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. You
    will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as
    they disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be preserved. When
    you receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary to
    communicate with you, it will be through Martin. When you are finally
    caught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. But you will have very
    little to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be able to
    betray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will not
    even betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a
    different person, with a different face.'

    He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In spite of the
    bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. It
    came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket,
    or manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an
    impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. However
    much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that
    belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease,
    amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage.
    'This is unavoidable,' his voice seemed to say; 'this is what we have got
    to do, unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life is
    worth living again.' A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out
    from Winston towards O'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the shadowy
    figure of Goldstein. When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders and
    his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible
    to believe that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was
    not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed to
    be impressed. She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently.
    O'Brien went on:

    'You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt
    you have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, a
    huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling
    messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special
    movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the
    Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible
    for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others.
    Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could
    not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would
    lead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot
    be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense.
    Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible. You
    will never have anything to sustain you, except the idea. You will get no
    comradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are caught, you will
    get no help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutely
    necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to
    smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. You will have to get used
    to living without results and without hope. You will work for a while,
    you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are
    the only results that you will ever see. There is no possibility that any
    perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead.
    Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls
    of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there
    is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible
    except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act
    collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to
    individual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Police
    there is no other way.'

    He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.

    'It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said to Julia. 'Wait.
    The decanter is still half full.'

    He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.

    'What shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faint
    suggestion of irony. 'To the confusion of the Thought Police? To the
    death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the future?'

    'To the past,' said Winston.

    'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.

    They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up to go.
    O'Brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat
    white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. It was important,
    he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very
    observant. As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget
    her existence. He took another pace or two up and down, then stopped.

    'There are details to be settled,' he said. 'I assume that you have a
    hiding-place of some kind?'

    Winston explained about the room over Mr Charrington's shop.

    'That will do for the moment. Later we will arrange something else for you.
    It is important to change one's hiding-place frequently. Meanwhile I shall
    send you a copy of THE BOOK'--even O'Brien, Winston noticed, seemed to
    pronounce the words as though they were in italics--'Goldstein's book, you
    understand, as soon as possible. It may be some days before I can get hold
    of one. There are not many in existence, as you can imagine. The Thought
    Police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce
    them. It makes very little difference. The book is indestructible. If
    the last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word for word. Do
    you carry a brief-case to work with you?' he added.

    'As a rule, yes.'

    'What is it like?'

    'Black, very shabby. With two straps.'

    'Black, two straps, very shabby--good. One day in the fairly near
    future--I cannot give a date--one of the messages among your morning's
    work will contain a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for a
    repeat. On the following day you will go to work without your brief-case.
    At some time during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the
    arm and say "I think you have dropped your brief-case." The one he gives
    you will contain a copy of Goldstein's book. You will return it within
    fourteen days.'

    They were silent for a moment.

    'There are a couple of minutes before you need go,' said O'Brien. 'We
    shall meet again--if we do meet again----'

    Winston looked up at him. 'In the place where there is no darkness?'
    he said hesitantly.

    O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. 'In the place where there
    is no darkness,' he said, as though he had recognized the allusion. 'And
    in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave?
    Any message? Any question?.'

    Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that he
    wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding
    generalities. Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien or the
    Brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the
    dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room
    over Mr Charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel
    engraving in its rosewood frame. Almost at random he said:

    'Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins "Oranges and lemons,
    say the bells of St Clement's"?'

    Again O'Brien nodded. With a sort of grave courtesy he completed the
    stanza:


    'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,
    You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,
    When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey,
    When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch.'


    'You knew the last line!' said Winston.

    'Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time for you to go.
    But wait. You had better let me give you one of these tablets.'

    As Winston stood up O'Brien held out a hand. His powerful grip crushed
    the bones of Winston's palm. At the door Winston looked back, but O'Brien
    seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. He was waiting
    with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond him
    Winston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the
    speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers. The incident was
    closed. Within thirty seconds, it occurred to him, O'Brien would be back
    at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party.




    Chapter 9



    Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was the right word. It had
    come into his head spontaneously. His body seemed to have not only the
    weakness of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his
    hand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood and
    lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving
    only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemed
    to be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled
    his feet, even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made
    his joints creak.

    He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So had everyone else in
    the Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, no
    Party work of any description, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six
    hours in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in
    mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction
    of Mr Charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but
    irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone
    interfering with him. The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped
    against his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and down
    the skin of his leg. Inside it was the book, which he had now had in his
    possession for six days and had not yet opened, nor even looked at.

    On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, the
    shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the waxworks,
    the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet,
    the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes,
    the booming of guns--after six days of this, when the great orgasm was
    quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up
    into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the
    2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last
    day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them to
    pieces--at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania was not
    after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Eurasia
    was an ally.

    There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. Merely
    it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, that
    Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a
    demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it
    happened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were
    luridly floodlit. The square was packed with several thousand people,
    including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the
    Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small
    lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over
    which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A little
    Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the
    microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony
    arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by
    the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres,
    deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of
    civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was
    almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then
    maddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the
    voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose
    uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all
    came from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps
    twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of
    paper was slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read it without
    pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the
    content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different.
    Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd.
    Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous
    commotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated
    were all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was
    sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous
    interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds
    and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity in
    clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from
    the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator,
    still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward,
    his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech.
    One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the
    crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had
    been changed.

    The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had
    switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only
    without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment
    he had other things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder
    while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not
    see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Excuse me, I think you've
    dropped your brief-case.' He took the brief-case abstractedly, without
    speaking. He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to
    look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was over he went
    straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time was now nearly
    twenty-three hours. The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise.
    The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to their
    posts, were hardly necessary.

    Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with
    Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now
    completely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books,
    pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs--all had to be rectified at
    lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known that
    the chiefs of the Department intended that within one week no reference
    to the war with Eurasia, or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in
    existence anywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more so because
    the processes that it involved could not be called by their true
    names. Everyone in the Records Department worked eighteen hours in the
    twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep. Mattresses were brought
    up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of
    sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from
    the canteen. Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells of
    sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he
    crawled back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another shower
    of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, half-burying the
    speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job was
    always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work.
    What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.
    Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any
    detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the
    geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one
    part of the world to another was considerable.

    By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping
    every few minutes. It was like struggling with some crushing physical task,
    something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless
    neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to remember
    it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the
    speakwrite, every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was
    as anxious as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be
    perfect. On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed
    down. For as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then one
    more cylinder, then nothing. Everywhere at about the same time the work
    was easing off. A deep and as it were secret sigh went through the
    Department. A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had been
    achieved. It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary
    evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened. At twelve hundred it
    was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the Ministry were free till
    tomorrow morning. Winston, still carrying the brief-case containing the
    book, which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his
    body while he slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in
    his bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.

    With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above
    Mr Charrington's shop. He was tired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened
    the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for
    coffee. Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. He
    sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.

    A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the
    cover. The print also looked slightly irregular. The pages were worn at
    the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through
    many hands. The inscription on the title-page ran:


    THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF
    OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM
    by
    Emmanuel Goldstein


    Winston began reading:


    Chapter I
    Ignorance is Strength

    Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,
    there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle,
    and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne
    countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their
    attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the
    essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous
    upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always
    reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,
    however far it is pushed one way or the other.

    The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable...


    Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he
    was reading, in comfort and safety. He was alone: no telescreen, no ear at
    the keyhole, no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the
    page with his hand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. From
    somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room
    itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock. He settled
    deeper into the arm-chair and put his feet up on the fender. It was bliss,
    it was eternity. Suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one
    knows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word, he opened it
    at a different place and found himself at Chapter III. He went on reading:


    Chapter III
    War is Peace

    The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event
    which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth
    century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire
    by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and
    Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only
    emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. The
    frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and
    in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general
    they follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern
    part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering
    Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the
    British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia,
    smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier,
    comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands
    and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.

    In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at
    war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is no
    longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early
    decades of the twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between
    combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause
    for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference.
    This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing
    attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous.
    On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,
    and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction
    of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which
    extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal,
    and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy,
    meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of
    people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few
    casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague
    frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round
    the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In
    the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage
    of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may
    cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its character. More
    exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of
    importance. Motives which were already present to some small extent in the
    great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and
    are consciously recognized and acted upon.

    To understand the nature of the present war--for in spite of the regrouping
    which occurs every few years, it is always the same war--one must realize
    in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of
    the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other
    two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences
    are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceania
    by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity
    and industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in
    a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of
    self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared
    to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of
    previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials
    is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three
    super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that
    it needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct
    economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of
    the super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them,
    there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville,
    Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population
    of the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions,
    and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly
    struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the
    disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the
    chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery
    that dictates the endless changes of alignment.

    All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of
    them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder
    climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods.
    But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever
    power controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or
    Southern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of the bodies
    of scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies.
    The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status
    of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended
    like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture
    more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments,
    to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted that
    the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas.
    The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo
    and the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian
    Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by
    Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and
    Eastasia is never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim to
    enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored:
    but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the territory
    which forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate.
    Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not
    really necessary to the world's economy. They add nothing to the wealth of
    the world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and
    the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which
    to wage another war. By their labour the slave populations allow the tempo
    of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the
    structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself,
    would not be essentially different.

    The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of
    DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by
    the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the
    machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end
    of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of
    consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when
    few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not
    urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes
    of destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry,
    dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and
    still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of
    that period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the vision of
    a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient--a
    glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete--was
    part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and
    technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to
    assume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly
    because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and
    revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on
    the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly
    regimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it
    was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and various
    devices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage,
    have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped,
    and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been
    fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still
    there. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it
    was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and
    therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the
    machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt,
    illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.
    And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of
    automatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible
    not to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of the
    average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at
    the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.

    But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the
    destruction--indeed, in some sense was the destruction--of a hierarchical
    society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to
    eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed
    a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most
    important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once
    became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no
    doubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal
    possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWER
    remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such
    a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were
    enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally
    stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for
    themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later
    realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep
    it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a
    basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as
    some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of
    doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency
    towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost
    the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially
    backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated,
    directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals.

    Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by
    restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during
    the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy
    of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation,
    capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were
    prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this,
    too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted
    were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was
    how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real
    wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be
    distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by
    continuous warfare.

    The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives,
    but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces,
    or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea,
    materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,
    and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are
    not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of
    expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.
    A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that
    would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as
    obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with
    further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle
    the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might
    exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs
    of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is
    a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on
    as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups
    somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity
    increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the
    distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early
    twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere,
    laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy
    his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the
    better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three
    servants, his private motor-car or helicopter--set him in a different world
    from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have
    a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call
    'the proles'. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the
    possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and
    poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and
    therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste
    seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.

    War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but
    accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would
    be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building
    temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even
    by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But
    this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a
    hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses,
    whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work,
    but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is
    expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow
    limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant
    fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic
    triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality
    appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is
    actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does
    not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is
    that a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which
    the Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an
    atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks
    one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party
    that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity
    as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party
    to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often
    be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or
    is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such
    knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Meanwhile
    no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that
    the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania
    the undisputed master of the entire world.

    All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an
    article of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more
    and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of
    power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search
    for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining
    activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any
    outlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has
    almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for 'Science'. The
    empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of
    the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of
    Ingsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can
    in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful
    arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are
    cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery. But
    in matters of vital importance--meaning, in effect, war and police
    espionage--the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least
    tolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of
    the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent
    thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is
    concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another
    human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred
    million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. In
    so far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter.
    The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor,
    studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions,
    gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of
    drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist,
    physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special
    subject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories
    of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the
    Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of
    the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are
    concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise
    larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more
    and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier
    gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities
    as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease
    germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce
    a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under
    the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship;
    others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays
    through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or
    producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at
    the earth's centre.

    But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none
    of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others.
    What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the
    atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present
    researches are likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its
    habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as
    early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about
    ten years later. At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on
    industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, and
    North America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all
    countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized
    society, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formal
    agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three
    powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against
    the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.
    And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or
    forty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing
    planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the
    fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating
    Fortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the
    submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand
    grenade are still in use. And in spite of the endless slaughters reported
    in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars,
    in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed
    in a few weeks, have never been repeated.

    None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves
    the risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is undertaken, it is
    usually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all three
    powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following,
    is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and
    well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely
    encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of
    friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years
    as to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomic
    bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all
    be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation
    impossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the
    remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it
    is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization.
    Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the
    Equator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken.
    This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the
    super-states are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the
    British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other
    hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine
    or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed on
    all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were
    to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it
    would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great
    physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred
    million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on
    the Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super-states.
    It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no
    contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners
    and coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always
    regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average
    citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or
    Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he
    were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are
    creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about
    them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the
    fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might
    evaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia,
    or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must
    never be crossed by anything except bombs.

    Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and
    acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states
    are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called
    Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is
    called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps
    better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not
    allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but
    he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and
    common sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable,
    and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all.
    Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of
    semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous
    warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer
    one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary,
    so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three
    sheaves of corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are
    simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are
    dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that
    the war should continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the
    fact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of
    reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of
    thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that
    by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character.

    In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or
    later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the
    past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies
    were kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried
    to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could
    not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military
    efficiency. So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other
    result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat
    had to be serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or
    religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when
    one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient
    nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for
    efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was
    necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly
    accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history
    books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of
    the kind that is practised today would have been impossible. War was a
    sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned
    it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be
    won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.

    But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.
    When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity.
    Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or
    disregarded. As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific
    are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a
    kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important.
    Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing is
    efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since each of the three
    super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within
    which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised. Reality
    only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life--the need to
    eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or
    stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death,
    and between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a
    distinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world,
    and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar
    space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down.
    The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars
    could not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving
    to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged
    to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but
    once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape
    they choose.

    The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is
    merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant
    animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of
    hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It
    eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the
    special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. War, it will
    be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups
    of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and
    therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another,
    and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are
    not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling
    group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make
    or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society
    intact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading. It would
    probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to
    exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the
    Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been
    replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same
    if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree
    to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For
    in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever
    from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly
    permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast
    majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is the
    inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.


    Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in remote distance a
    rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling of being alone with the
    forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude
    and safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness
    of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from
    the window that played upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or more
    exactly it reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but
    that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it
    had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was
    the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful,
    more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are those
    that tell you what you know already. He had just turned back to Chapter I
    when he heard Julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair
    to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag on the floor and flung herself
    into his arms. It was more than a week since they had seen one another.

    'I've got THE BOOK,' he said as they disentangled themselves.

    'Oh, you've got it? Good,' she said without much interest, and almost
    immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee.

    They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an
    hour. The evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up
    the counterpane. From below came the familiar sound of singing and the
    scrape of boots on the flagstones. The brawny red-armed woman whom Winston
    had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. There
    seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro
    between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes
    pegs and breaking forth into lusty song. Julia had settled down on her
    side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. He reached
    out for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against the
    bedhead.

    'We must read it,' he said. 'You too. All members of the Brotherhood have
    to read it.'

    'You read it,' she said with her eyes shut. 'Read it aloud. That's the
    best way. Then you can explain it to me as you go.'

    The clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen. They had three or four hours
    ahead of them. He propped the book against his knees and began reading:


    Chapter I
    Ignorance is Strength

    Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,
    there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle,
    and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne
    countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their
    attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the
    essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous
    upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always
    reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,
    however far it is pushed one way or the other


    'Julia, are you awake?' said Winston.

    'Yes, my love, I'm listening. Go on. It's marvellous.'

    He continued reading:


    The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of
    the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change
    places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim--for it
    is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed
    by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside
    their daily lives--is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in
    which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is
    the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods
    the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always
    comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their
    capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the
    Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they
    are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their
    objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of
    servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group
    splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the
    struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never
    even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an
    exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of
    a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human
    being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no
    advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has
    ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of
    the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the
    name of their masters.

    By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become
    obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who
    interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that
    inequality was the unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course,
    had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put
    forward there was a significant change. In the past the need for a
    hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the
    High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests,
    lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally
    been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the
    grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always made
    use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however, the
    concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not
    yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the
    past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and
    then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown.
    The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand.
    Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was
    the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions
    of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages.
    But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the
    aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly
    abandoned. The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the
    century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as
    it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating
    UNfreedom and INequality. These new movements, of course, grew out of the
    old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their
    ideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze
    history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to happen once
    more, and then stop. As usual, the High were to be turned out by the
    Middle, who would then become the High; but this time, by conscious
    strategy, the High would be able to maintain their position permanently.

    The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical
    knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed
    before the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history was now
    intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it
    was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early
    as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become
    technically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their
    native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that
    favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real
    need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlier
    ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable.
    Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machine
    production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary
    for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary
    for them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from
    the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power,
    human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to
    be averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was
    in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of
    an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of
    brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human
    imagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold
    even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The
    heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believed
    in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality
    before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be
    influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of the
    twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were
    authoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the
    moment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever
    name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the
    general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which
    had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonment
    without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions,
    torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation
    of whole populations--not only became common again, but were tolerated
    and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and
    progressive.

    It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and
    counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals
    emerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been
    foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which
    had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world
    which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What
    kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. The new
    aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists,
    technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists,
    teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, whose
    origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the
    working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of
    monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their
    opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by
    luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what
    they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last
    difference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the
    tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups
    were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to
    leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be
    uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church
    of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason
    for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its
    citizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however,
    made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio
    carried the process further. With the development of television, and
    the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit
    simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every
    citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching,
    could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police
    and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of
    communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only complete
    obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion
    on all subjects, now existed for the first time.

    After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society
    regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High
    group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what
    was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the
    only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege
    are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called
    'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years of
    the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer
    hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a
    group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the
    Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the
    Party owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and
    disposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the
    Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost
    unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of
    collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class
    were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the
    capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses,
    transport--everything had been taken away from them: and since these
    things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be
    public property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement
    and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in
    the Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand,
    that economic inequality has been made permanent.

    But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than
    this. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power.
    Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that
    the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented
    Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and
    willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule
    all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could
    guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately
    the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.

    After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality
    disappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in
    fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow
    demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert.
    The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never
    revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are
    oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of
    comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. The
    recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are
    not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations
    can and do happen without having political results, because there is no
    way in which discontent can become articulate. As for the problem of
    over-production, which has been latent in our society since the development
    of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare
    (see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the
    necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore,
    the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able,
    under-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and
    scepticism in their own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational.
    It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the
    directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately
    below it. The consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in
    a negative way.

    Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already,
    the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the pyramid comes
    Big Brother. Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every success,
    every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all
    knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue
    directly from his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen Big
    Brother. He is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen. We
    may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already
    considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big Brother is the guise
    in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His function is
    to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which
    are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization.
    Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Its numbers limited to six
    millions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania.
    Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is
    described as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands.
    Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as 'the
    proles', numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population. In the terms
    of our earlier classification, the proles are the Low: for the slave
    population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror
    to conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.

    In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary. The
    child of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party.
    Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the
    age of sixteen. Nor is there any racial discrimination, or any marked
    domination of one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of
    pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the Party, and
    the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of
    that area. In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that
    they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania has
    no capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody
    knows. Except that English is its chief LINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak its
    official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers are not
    held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It is
    true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what
    at first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to-and-fro
    movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or
    even in the pre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the Party
    there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure
    that weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious
    members of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise.
    Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. The
    most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent,
    are simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated. But this
    state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of
    principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does
    not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there
    were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be
    perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of
    the proletariat. In the crucial years, the fact that the Party was not a
    hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind
    of Socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called
    'class privilege' assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent.
    He did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical,
    nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been
    shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic Church
    have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. The essence of
    oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of
    a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon
    the living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate
    its successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but
    with perpetuating itself. WHO wields power is not important, provided that
    the hierarchical structure remains always the same.

    All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that
    characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of
    the Party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from being
    perceived. Physical rebellion, or any preliminary move towards rebellion,
    is at present not possible. From the proletarians nothing is to be feared.
    Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and
    from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without
    any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world
    could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous if the advance
    of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly;
    but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the
    level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses
    hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can
    be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party
    member, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on
    the most unimportant subject can be tolerated.

    A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the Thought
    Police. Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone.
    Wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in
    bed, he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is
    being inspected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships, his
    relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children, the expression
    of his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the
    characteristic movements of his body, are all jealously scrutinized. Not
    only any actual misdemeanour, but any eccentricity, however small, any
    change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom
    of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected. He has no freedom of
    choice in any direction whatever. On the other hand his actions are not
    regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceania
    there is no law. Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain
    death are not formally forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests,
    tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment
    for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the
    wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the
    future. A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions,
    but the right instincts. Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him
    are never plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare the
    contradictions inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox
    (in Newspeak a GOODTHINKER), he will in all circumstances know, without
    taking thought, what is the true belief or the desirable emotion. But in
    any case an elaborate mental training, undergone in childhood and grouping
    itself round the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP, BLACKWHITE, and DOUBLETHINK,
    makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever.

    A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites
    from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred
    of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and
    self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents
    produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards
    and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the
    speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude
    are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. The first
    and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young
    children, is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP. CRIMESTOP means the faculty
    of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous
    thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to
    perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if
    they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train
    of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. CRIMESTOP,
    in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the
    contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's own
    mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body.
    Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is
    omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since in reality Big
    Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need
    for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts.
    The keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has
    two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the
    habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the
    plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to
    say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means
    also the ability to BELIEVE that black is white, and more, to KNOW that
    black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.
    This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the
    system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known
    in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK.

    The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is
    subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that
    the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions
    partly because he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from
    the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is
    necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and
    that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising. But by
    far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the
    need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is not merely that
    speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought
    up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in
    all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political
    alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one's mind, or even one's
    policy, is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia
    (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always
    have been the enemy. And if the facts say otherwise then the facts must
    be altered. Thus history is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day
    falsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as
    necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and
    espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.

    The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events,
    it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written
    records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the
    memories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records
    and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that
    the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it. It also follows that
    though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specific
    instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at
    the moment, then this new version IS the past, and no different past can
    ever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens, the same
    event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of
    a year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and
    clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now.
    It will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the
    training of memory. To make sure that all written records agree with
    the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act. But it is also
    necessary to REMEMBER that events happened in the desired manner. And if
    it is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written
    records, then it is necessary to FORGET that one has done so. The trick of
    doing this can be learned like any other mental technique. It is learned
    by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are intelligent
    as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, 'reality
    control'. In Newspeak it is called DOUBLETHINK, though DOUBLETHINK
    comprises much else as well.

    DOUBLETHINK means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's
    mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual
    knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows
    that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of DOUBLETHINK
    he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. The process has to
    be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision,
    but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of
    falsity and hence of guilt. DOUBLETHINK lies at the very heart of Ingsoc,
    since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception while
    retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell
    deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that
    has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to
    draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the
    existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the
    reality which one denies--all this is indispensably necessary. Even in
    using the word DOUBLETHINK it is necessary to exercise DOUBLETHINK. For
    by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a
    fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely,
    with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means
    of DOUBLETHINK that the Party has been able--and may, for all we know,
    continue to be able for thousands of years--to arrest the course of
    history.

    All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified
    or because they grew soft. Either they became stupid and arrogant, failed
    to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; or
    they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have
    used force, and once again were overthrown. They fell, that is to say,
    either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is the
    achievement of the Party to have produced a system of thought in which
    both conditions can exist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual
    basis could the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If one is to rule,
    and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality.
    For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one's own
    infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.

    It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of DOUBLETHINK are
    those who invented DOUBLETHINK and know that it is a vast system of mental
    cheating. In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is
    happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is.
    In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the
    more intelligent, the less sane. One clear illustration of this is the
    fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social
    scale. Those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are
    the subject peoples of the disputed territories. To these people the war
    is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies
    like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a matter of complete
    indifference to them. They are aware that a change of overlordship means
    simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who
    treat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightly more favoured
    workers whom we call 'the proles' are only intermittently conscious of the
    war. When it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and
    hatred, but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for
    long periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks of the Party,
    and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm is found.
    World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be
    impossible. This peculiar linking-together of opposites--knowledge with
    ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism--is one of the chief distinguishing
    marks of Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds with contradictions
    even when there is no practical reason for them. Thus, the Party rejects
    and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally
    stood, and it chooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches
    a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past, and it
    dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual
    workers and was adopted for that reason. It systematically undermines the
    solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a
    direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names of the
    four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in
    their deliberate reversal of the facts. The Ministry of Peace concerns
    itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love
    with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These
    contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary
    hypocrisy; they are deliberate exercises in DOUBLETHINK. For it is only
    by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely.
    In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. If human equality is
    to be for ever averted--if the High, as we have called them, are to keep
    their places permanently--then the prevailing mental condition must be
    controlled insanity.

    But there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored.
    It is; WHY should human equality be averted? Supposing that the mechanics
    of the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for this
    huge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment
    of time?

    Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen. the mystique of the
    Party, and above all of the Inner Party, depends upon DOUBLETHINK But
    deeper than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinct
    that first led to the seizure of power and brought DOUBLETHINK, the
    Thought Police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary
    paraphernalia into existence afterwards. This motive really consists...


    Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound. It
    seemed to him that Julia had been very still for some time past. She was
    lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed
    on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Her breast rose
    and fell slowly and regularly.

    'Julia.'

    No answer.

    'Julia, are you awake?'

    No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it carefully on the floor,
    lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of them.

    He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. He understood
    HOW; he did not understand WHY. Chapter I, like Chapter III, had not
    actually told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized
    the knowledge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew
    better than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a
    minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was
    untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you
    were not mad. A yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the
    window and fell across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on his face
    and the girl's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy,
    confident feeling. He was safe, everything was all right. He fell asleep
    murmuring 'Sanity is not statistical,' with the feeling that this remark
    contained in it a profound wisdom.

    *****

    When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time,
    but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only
    twenty-thirty. He lay dozing for a while; then the usual deep-lunged
    singing struck up from the yard below:


    'It was only an 'opeless fancy,
    It passed like an Ipril dye,
    But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred
    They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!'


    The drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity. You still heard it
    all over the place. It had outlived the Hate Song. Julia woke at the
    sound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.

    'I'm hungry,' she said. 'Let's make some more coffee. Damn! The stove's
    gone out and the water's cold.' She picked the stove up and shook it.
    'There's no oil in it.'

    'We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.'

    'The funny thing is I made sure it was full. I'm going to put my clothes
    on,' she added. 'It seems to have got colder.'

    Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable voice sang on:


    'They sye that time 'eals all things,
    They sye you can always forget;
    But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years
    They twist my 'eart-strings yet!'


    As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window.
    The sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not shining into the
    yard any longer. The flagstones were wet as though they had just been
    washed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh
    and pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the woman
    marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling
    silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered
    whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty
    or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; together they
    gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As he
    looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching
    up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him
    for the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to
    him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by
    childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the
    grain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and
    after all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a block
    of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body
    of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be held
    inferior to the flower?

    'She's beautiful,' he murmured.

    'She's a metre across the hips, easily,' said Julia.

    'That is her style of beauty,' said Winston.

    He held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm. From the hip to
    the knee her flank was against his. Out of their bodies no child would
    ever come. That was the one thing they could never do. Only by word of
    mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman down
    there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile
    belly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It might
    easily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps,
    of wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized
    fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been
    laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending,
    scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over
    thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing. The mystical
    reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of
    the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into
    interminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the same
    for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people
    under the sky were also very much the same--everywhere, all over the world,
    hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant
    of one another's existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and
    yet almost exactly the same--people who had never learned to think but who
    were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that
    would one day overturn the world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles!
    Without having read to the end of THE BOOK, he knew that that must be
    Goldstein's final message. The future belonged to the proles. And could he
    be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be
    just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes,
    because at the least it would be a world of sanity. Where there is
    equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strength
    would change into consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could not
    doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end
    their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a
    thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds,
    passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share
    and could not kill.

    'Do you remember,' he said, 'the thrush that sang to us, that first day,
    at the edge of the wood?'

    'He wasn't singing to us,' said Julia. 'He was singing to please himself.
    Not even that. He was just singing.'

    The birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did not sing. All round the
    world, in London and New York, in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious,
    forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin,
    in the villages of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and
    Japan--everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous
    by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and still singing.
    Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come.
    You were the dead, theirs was the future. But you could share in that
    future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passed
    on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.

    'We are the dead,' he said.

    'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.

    'You are the dead,' said an iron voice behind them.

    They sprang apart. Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice. He
    could see the white all round the irises of Julia's eyes. Her face had
    turned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone
    stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.

    'You are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.

    'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.

    'It was behind the picture,' said the voice. 'Remain exactly where you
    are. Make no movement until you are ordered.'

    It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing except
    stand gazing into one another's eyes. To run for life, to get out of the
    house before it was too late--no such thought occurred to them. Unthinkable
    to disobey the iron voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch
    had been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture had fallen
    to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.

    'Now they can see us,' said Julia.

    'Now we can see you,' said the voice. 'Stand out in the middle of the
    room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands behind your heads. Do not touch
    one another.'

    They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia's
    body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. He could
    just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control.
    There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside.
    The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was being dragged across the
    stones. The woman's singing had stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling
    clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a
    confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.

    'The house is surrounded,' said Winston.

    'The house is surrounded,' said the voice.

    He heard Julia snap her teeth together. 'I suppose we may as well say
    good-bye,' she said.

    'You may as well say good-bye,' said the voice. And then another quite
    different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impression
    of having heard before, struck in; 'And by the way, while we are on the
    subject, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to
    chop off your head"!'

    Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston's back. The head of a ladder
    had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. Someone was
    climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs.
    The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on
    their feet and truncheons in their hands.

    Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One
    thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them an
    excuse to hit you! A man with a smooth prize-fighter's jowl in which the
    mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon
    meditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. The
    feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face
    and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tip
    of a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, and
    then passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked up the glass
    paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.

    The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from
    a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought Winston, how small it
    always was! There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a
    violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of
    the men had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling her up
    like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for
    breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes
    her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in his
    terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly
    pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her
    breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was
    there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else
    it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her
    up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack.
    Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with
    the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that
    was the last he saw of her.

    He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of their
    own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his
    mind. He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what
    they had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted
    to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or
    three hours ago. He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine,
    meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light
    be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered whether
    after all he and Julia had mistaken the time--had slept the clock round
    and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty
    on the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further.
    It was not interesting.

    There was another, lighter step in the passage. Mr Charrington came into
    the room. The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more
    subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's appearance. His
    eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.

    'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.

    A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston suddenly
    realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the
    telescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but
    his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not
    wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as though
    verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He was
    still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His body
    had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone
    only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation.
    The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole
    lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It
    was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to
    Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge,
    at a member of the Thought Police.





    PART THREE




    Chapter 1



    He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love,
    but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged
    windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps
    flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound
    which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench, or
    shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the
    door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden
    seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.

    There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they
    had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was also
    hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four
    hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know,
    probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when
    they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.

    He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed
    on his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpected
    movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for food
    was growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread.
    He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his
    overalls. It was even possible--he thought this because from time to time
    something seemed to tickle his leg--that there might be a sizeable bit of
    crust there. In the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he
    slipped a hand into his pocket.

    'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Hands out of
    pockets in the cells!'

    He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being brought
    here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary
    prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how
    long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no
    daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling
    place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in,
    but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. The
    majority of them were common criminals, but there were a few political
    prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty
    bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much
    interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference
    in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party
    prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals
    seemed to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards,
    fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene
    words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious
    hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when
    it tried to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed to be on
    good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle
    cigarettes through the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated the
    common criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle
    them roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which
    most of the prisoners expected to be sent. It was 'all right' in the
    camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes.
    There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was
    homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilled
    from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the common
    criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort
    of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.

    There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description:
    drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes.
    Some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine
    to suppress them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with
    great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down
    in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards,
    who had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with
    which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across
    Winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself
    upright and followed them out with a yell of 'F---- bastards!' Then,
    noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston's
    knees on to the bench.

    'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said. 'I wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggers
    put me there. They dono 'ow to treat a lady, do they?' She paused, patted
    her breast, and belched. 'Pardon,' she said, 'I ain't meself, quite.'

    She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.

    'Thass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes. 'Never keep it
    down, thass what I say. Get it up while it's fresh on your stomach, like.'

    She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immediately
    to take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him
    towards her, breathing beer and vomit into his face.

    'Wass your name, dearie?' she said.

    'Smith,' said Winston.

    'Smith?' said the woman. 'Thass funny. My name's Smith too. Why,' she
    added sentimentally, 'I might be your mother!'

    She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about the right age and
    physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty
    years in a forced-labour camp.

    No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the ordinary
    criminals ignored the Party prisoners. 'The polITS,' they called them,
    with a sort of uninterested contempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified
    of speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only
    once, when two Party members, both women, were pressed close together on
    the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly-whispered
    words; and in particular a reference to something called 'room one-oh-one',
    which he did not understand.

    It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. The
    dull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better and
    sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When
    it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for
    food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments
    when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality
    that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. He felt the smash of
    truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself
    grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. He
    hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved her
    and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the
    rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered
    what was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering
    hope. O'Brien might know that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood, he
    had said, never tried to save its members. But there was the razor blade;
    they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five
    seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would bite
    into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held
    it would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, which
    shrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would
    use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural to exist
    from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with the
    certainty that there was torture at the end of it.

    Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the
    walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always lost count at
    some point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what time
    of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight
    outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In
    this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out.
    It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O'Brien had seemed to
    recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows. His
    cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it
    might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself
    mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his
    body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.

    There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened with
    a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to
    glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured
    face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned
    to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The
    poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door clanged shut again.

    Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as
    though having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and then
    began to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston's
    presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above
    the level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were
    sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days away
    from a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving
    him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and
    nervous movements.

    Winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. He must speak
    to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was even
    conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.

    'Ampleforth,' he said.

    There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, mildly startled.
    His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.

    'Ah, Smith!' he said. 'You too!'

    'What are you in for?'

    'To tell you the truth--' He sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite
    Winston. 'There is only one offence, is there not?' he said.

    'And have you committed it?'

    'Apparently I have.'

    He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, as
    though trying to remember something.

    'These things happen,' he began vaguely. 'I have been able to recall one
    instance--a possible instance. It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. We
    were producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the
    word "God" to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!' he added
    almost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. 'It was impossible
    to change the line. The rhyme was "rod". Do you realize that there are only
    twelve rhymes to "rod" in the entire language? For days I had racked my
    brains. There WAS no other rhyme.'

    The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed out of it and for
    a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy
    of the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the dirt
    and scrubby hair.

    'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said, 'that the whole history of English
    poetry has been determined by the fact that the English language lacks
    rhymes?'

    No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in the
    circumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting.

    'Do you know what time of day it is?' he said.

    Ampleforth looked startled again. 'I had hardly thought about it. They
    arrested me--it could be two days ago--perhaps three.' His eyes flitted
    round the walls, as though he half expected to find a window somewhere.
    'There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not see
    how one can calculate the time.'

    They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason,
    a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat quietly, his
    hands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow
    bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one
    knee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still.
    Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour--it was difficult to judge. Once more
    there was a sound of boots outside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon,
    very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would
    mean that his own turn had come.

    The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell. With
    a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.

    'Room 101,' he said.

    Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely
    perturbed, but uncomprehending.

    What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston's belly had
    revived. His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball
    falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six
    thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the
    screaming; O'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in his
    entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the wave
    of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsons
    walked into the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.

    This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.

    'YOU here!' he said.

    Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor
    surprise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and down, evidently
    unable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was
    apparent that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look,
    as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the
    middle distance.

    'What are you in for?' said Winston.

    'Thoughtcrime!' said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone of his voice
    implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous
    horror that such a word could be applied to himself. He paused opposite
    Winston and began eagerly appealing to him: 'You don't think they'll shoot
    me, do you, old chap? They don't shoot you if you haven't actually done
    anything--only thoughts, which you can't help? I know they give you a fair
    hearing. Oh, I trust them for that! They'll know my record, won't they?
    YOU know what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of
    course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party, didn't I? I'll get
    off with five years, don't you think? Or even ten years? A chap like me
    could make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp. They wouldn't shoot me
    for going off the rails just once?'

    'Are you guilty?' said Winston.

    'Of course I'm guilty!' cried Parsons with a servile glance at the
    telescreen. 'You don't think the Party would arrest an innocent man,
    do you?' His frog-like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly
    sanctimonious expression. 'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,'
    he said sententiously. 'It's insidious. It can get hold of you without
    your even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes,
    that's a fact. There I was, working away, trying to do my bit--never knew
    I had any bad stuff in my mind at all. And then I started talking in my
    sleep. Do you know what they heard me saying?'

    He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to
    utter an obscenity.

    '"Down with Big Brother!" Yes, I said that! Said it over and over again,
    it seems. Between you and me, old man, I'm glad they got me before it went
    any further. Do you know what I'm going to say to them when I go up before
    the tribunal? "Thank you," I'm going to say, "thank you for saving me
    before it was too late."'

    'Who denounced you?' said Winston.

    'It was my little daughter,' said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride.
    'She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was saying, and nipped off to
    the patrols the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?
    I don't bear her any grudge for it. In fact I'm proud of her. It shows I
    brought her up in the right spirit, anyway.'

    He made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting a
    longing glance at the lavatory pan. Then he suddenly ripped down his
    shorts.

    'Excuse me, old man,' he said. 'I can't help it. It's the waiting.'

    He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. Winston covered his
    face with his hands.

    'Smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Uncover your
    face. No faces covered in the cells.'

    Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and
    abundantly. It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell
    stank abominably for hours afterwards.

    Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went, mysteriously. One, a
    woman, was consigned to 'Room 101', and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel
    and turn a different colour when she heard the words. A time came when, if
    it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if
    it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were six prisoners
    in the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat
    a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large,
    harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom
    that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food
    tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face
    and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone's eye.

    The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent
    a momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking man
    who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what was
    startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because of
    its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the
    eyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or
    something.

    The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winston
    did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as
    vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes.
    Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation.
    The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the
    cell. There was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. The
    eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, then
    turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible
    attraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up,
    waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls,
    and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the
    skull-faced man.

    There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. The chinless man
    jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands
    behind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused
    the gift.

    'Bumstead!' roared the voice. '2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall that piece of
    bread!'

    The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.

    'Remain standing where you are,' said the voice. 'Face the door. Make no
    movement.'

    The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were quivering
    uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the young officer entered and
    stepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with
    enormous arms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man,
    and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with
    all the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man's mouth.
    The force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. His body
    was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory
    seat. For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from
    his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed
    unconscious, came out of him. Then he rolled over and raised himself
    unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two
    halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.

    The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. The
    chinless man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face the
    flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured
    mass with a black hole in the middle of it.

    From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls.
    His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever,
    as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for
    his humiliation.

    The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated the
    skull-faced man.

    'Room 101,' he said.

    There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side. The man had actually
    flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his hand clasped together.

    'Comrade! Officer!' he cried. 'You don't have to take me to that place!
    Haven't I told you everything already? What else is it you want to know?
    There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing! Just tell me what it is and
    I'll confess straight off. Write it down and I'll sign it--anything!
    Not room 101!'

    'Room 101,' said the officer.

    The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not have
    believed possible. It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.

    'Do anything to me!' he yelled. 'You've been starving me for weeks. Finish
    it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five
    years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is
    and I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do
    to them. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn't six
    years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in
    front of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!'

    'Room 101,' said the officer.

    The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though with
    some idea that he could put another victim in his own place. His eyes
    settled on the smashed face of the chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.

    'That's the one you ought to be taking, not me!' he shouted. 'You didn't
    hear what he was saying after they bashed his face. Give me a chance and
    I'll tell you every word of it. HE'S the one that's against the Party, not
    me.' The guards stepped forward. The man's voice rose to a shriek. 'You
    didn't hear him!' he repeated. 'Something went wrong with the telescreen.
    HE'S the one you want. Take him, not me!'

    The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just at
    this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one
    of the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless
    howling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose,
    but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds
    they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on
    their knees, looking straight in front of them. The howling stopped; the
    man had no breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was a
    different kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingers
    of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.

    'Room 101,' said the officer.

    The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his
    crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him.

    A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was
    taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston was
    alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow
    bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the
    telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had
    dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it,
    but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky and
    evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a
    sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get up
    because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit
    down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of
    staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little under
    control the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of
    O'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might
    arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought
    of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he.
    She might be screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: 'If I could
    save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.' But that
    was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought
    to take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything,
    except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you
    were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain
    should increase? But that question was not answerable yet.

    The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien came in.

    Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all
    caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the
    presence of the telescreen.

    'They've got you too!' he cried.

    'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful
    irony. He stepped aside. From behind him there emerged a broad-chested
    guard with a long black truncheon in his hand.

    'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien. 'Don't deceive yourself. You did
    know it--you have always known it.'

    Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of
    that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand. It might
    fall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on
    the elbow----

    The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping the
    stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded into yellow
    light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!
    The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The
    guard was laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate was
    answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase
    of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop.
    Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain
    there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed
    on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.




    Chapter 2



    He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was
    higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he
    could not move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his
    face. O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At
    the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic
    syringe.

    Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually.
    He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite
    different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he
    had been down there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested
    him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not
    continuous. There had been times when consciousness, even the sort of
    consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again
    after a blank interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks
    or only seconds, there was no way of knowing.

    With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. Later he was
    to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine
    interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a
    long range of crimes--espionage, sabotage, and the like--to which everyone
    had to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality,
    though the torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how long
    the beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were five
    or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was
    fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes
    it was boots. There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless
    as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless
    effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks,
    in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin,
    in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times
    when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed
    to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not
    force himself into losing consciousness. There were times when his nerve
    so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating
    began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough
    to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There
    were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing
    nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of
    pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he
    said to himself: 'I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the
    pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will
    tell them what they want.' Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly
    stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell,
    left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again.
    There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly,
    because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cell
    with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin
    wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. He
    remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair,
    and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse,
    tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over
    him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make
    him sleep.

    The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror
    to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were
    unsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms
    but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and
    flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which
    lasted--he thought, he could not be sure--ten or twelve hours at a stretch.
    These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but
    it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung
    his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to
    urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water;
    but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of
    arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioning
    that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for
    him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of
    lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as
    from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a
    single session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened
    at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes
    they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in
    the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even
    now he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to
    undo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of
    questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. In the
    end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and
    fists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that
    signed, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find out
    what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the
    bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Party
    members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public
    funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that
    he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as
    1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of
    capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his
    wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife
    was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch
    with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which
    had included almost every human being he had ever known. It was easier to
    confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all
    true. It was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes
    of the Party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.

    There were also memories of another kind. They stood out in his mind
    disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.

    He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he
    could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of
    instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more
    luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and
    was swallowed up.

    He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights.
    A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavy
    boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched in,
    followed by two guards.

    'Room 101,' said the officer.

    The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winston
    either; he was looking only at the dials.

    He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious,
    golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the
    top of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things he had
    succeeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire
    history of his life to an audience who knew it already. With him were the
    guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, O'Brien, Julia,
    Mr Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with
    laughter. Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had
    somehow been skipped over and had not happened. Everything was all right,
    there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare,
    understood, forgiven.

    He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had
    heard O'Brien's voice. All through his interrogation, although he had
    never seen him, he had had the feeling that O'Brien was at his elbow, just
    out of sight. It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who
    set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It
    was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should
    have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the
    drugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and
    suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was
    the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once--Winston could not remember
    whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment
    of wakefulness--a voice murmured in his ear: 'Don't worry, Winston; you
    are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now the
    turning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you perfect.' He
    was not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voice
    that had said to him, 'We shall meet in the place where there is no
    darkness,' in that other dream, seven years ago.

    He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period of
    blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually
    materialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move.
    His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head
    was gripped in some manner. O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and
    rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with
    pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older
    than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under
    his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round
    the face.

    'I told you,' said O'Brien, 'that if we met again it would be here.'

    'Yes,' said Winston.

    Without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien's hand, a wave of
    pain flooded his body. It was a frightening pain, because he could not see
    what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was
    being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening,
    or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being
    wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although
    the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was
    the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and
    breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.

    'You are afraid,' said O'Brien, watching his face, 'that in another moment
    something is going to break. Your especial fear is that it will be your
    backbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart
    and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking,
    is it not, Winston?'

    Winston did not answer. O'Brien drew back the lever on the dial. The wave
    of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come.

    'That was forty,' said O'Brien. 'You can see that the numbers on this dial
    run up to a hundred. Will you please remember, throughout our conversation,
    that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to
    whatever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to
    prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level of
    intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understand
    that?'

    'Yes,' said Winston.

    O'Brien's manner became less severe. He resettled his spectacles
    thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. When he spoke his voice
    was gentle and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a
    priest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.

    'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' he said, 'because you are worth
    trouble. You know perfectly well what is the matter with you. You have
    known it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. You are
    mentally deranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable to
    remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other
    events which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have never
    cured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was a small
    effort of the will that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well
    aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is
    a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, which power is
    Oceania at war with?'

    'When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.'

    'With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia,
    has it not?'

    Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak and then did not
    speak. He could not take his eyes away from the dial.

    'The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what you think you
    remember.'

    'I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not at
    war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance with them. The war was
    against Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. Before that----'

    O'Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.

    'Another example,' he said. 'Some years ago you had a very serious delusion
    indeed. You believed that three men, three one-time Party members named
    Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--men who were executed for treachery and
    sabotage after making the fullest possible confession--were not guilty of
    the crimes they were charged with. You believed that you had seen
    unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were
    false. There was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination.
    You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It was a
    photograph something like this.'

    An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For
    perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was
    a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was THE
    photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and
    Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon
    eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before
    his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it,
    unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to
    wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as
    a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the
    dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at
    least to see it.

    'It exists!' he cried.

    'No,' said O'Brien.

    He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall.
    O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling
    away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.
    O'Brien turned away from the wall.

    'Ashes,' he said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist.
    It never existed.'

    'But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it.
    You remember it.'

    'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.

    Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly
    helplessness. If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying, it
    would not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien
    had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have
    forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of
    forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps
    that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the
    thought that defeated him.

    O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than ever he had the
    air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.

    'There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past,' he said.
    'Repeat it, if you please.'

    '"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present
    controls the past,"' repeated Winston obediently.

    '"Who controls the present controls the past,"' said O'Brien, nodding his
    head with slow approval. 'Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past has
    real existence?'

    Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. His eyes flitted
    towards the dial. He not only did not know whether 'yes' or 'no' was the
    answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he
    believed to be the true one.

    O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said.
    'Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. I
    will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Is
    there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past
    is still happening?'

    'No.'

    'Then where does the past exist, if at all?'

    'In records. It is written down.'

    'In records. And----?'

    'In the mind. In human memories.'

    'In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we
    control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?'

    'But how can you stop people remembering things?' cried Winston again
    momentarily forgetting the dial. 'It is involuntary. It is outside oneself.
    How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!'

    O'Brien's manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the dial.

    'On the contrary,' he said, 'YOU have not controlled it. That is what has
    brought you here. You are here because you have failed in humility, in
    self-discipline. You would not make the act of submission which is the
    price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the
    disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is
    something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe
    that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into
    thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the
    same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.
    Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual
    mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the
    mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party
    holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by
    looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got
    to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the
    will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane.'

    He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying to
    sink in.

    'Do you remember,' he went on, 'writing in your diary, "Freedom is the
    freedom to say that two plus two make four"?'

    'Yes,' said Winston.

    O'Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb
    hidden and the four fingers extended.

    'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'

    'Four.'

    'And if the party says that it is not four but five--then how many?'

    'Four.'

    The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up to
    fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's body. The air tore
    into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his
    teeth he could not stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still
    extended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly
    eased.

    'How many fingers, Winston?'

    'Four.'

    The needle went up to sixty.

    'How many fingers, Winston?'

    'Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!'

    The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. The heavy,
    stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. The fingers stood up
    before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate,
    but unmistakably four.

    'How many fingers, Winston?'

    'Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!'

    'How many fingers, Winston?'

    'Five! Five! Five!'

    'No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think there are
    four. How many fingers, please?'

    'Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!'

    Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round his shoulders. He had
    perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds that had held his
    body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably,
    his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For a
    moment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy
    arm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that O'Brien was his protector,
    that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source,
    and that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.

    'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said O'Brien gently.

    'How can I help it?' he blubbered. 'How can I help seeing what is in front
    of my eyes? Two and two are four.'

    'Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three.
    Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not
    easy to become sane.'

    He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again,
    but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him
    merely weak and cold. O'Brien motioned with his head to the man in the
    white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in
    the white coat bent down and looked closely into Winston's eyes, felt his
    pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then he
    nodded to O'Brien.

    'Again,' said O'Brien.

    The pain flowed into Winston's body. The needle must be at seventy,
    seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He knew that the fingers
    were still there, and still four. All that mattered was somehow to stay
    alive until the spasm was over. He had ceased to notice whether he was
    crying out or not. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O'Brien
    had drawn back the lever.

    'How many fingers, Winston?'

    'Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could. I am trying
    to see five.'

    'Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or really to see
    them?'

    'Really to see them.'

    'Again,' said O'Brien.

    Perhaps the needle was eighty--ninety. Winston could not intermittently
    remember why the pain was happening. Behind his screwed-up eyelids a
    forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and
    out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying
    to count them, he could not remember why. He knew only that it was
    impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious
    identity between five and four. The pain died down again. When he opened
    his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing.
    Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past in
    either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes again.

    'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'

    'I don't know. I don't know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four,
    five, six--in all honesty I don't know.'

    'Better,' said O'Brien.

    A needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful,
    healing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was already
    half-forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien.
    At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart
    seemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out
    a hand and laid it on O'Brien's arm. He had never loved him so deeply as
    at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The old
    feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friend
    or an enemy, had come back. O'Brien was a person who could be talked to.
    Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brien
    had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was
    certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some
    sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or
    other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place
    where they could meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with an
    expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.
    When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.

    'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.

    'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.'

    'Do you know how long you have been here?'

    'I don't know. Days, weeks, months--I think it is months.'

    'And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?'

    'To make them confess.'

    'No, that is not the reason. Try again.'

    'To punish them.'

    'No!' exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his
    face had suddenly become both stern and animated. 'No! Not merely to
    extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have
    brought you here? To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand,
    Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands
    uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have
    committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is
    all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them.
    Do you understand what I mean by that?'

    He was bending over Winston. His face looked enormous because of its
    nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below. Moreover it
    was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston's
    heart shrank. If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into
    the bed. He felt certain that O'Brien was about to twist the dial out of
    sheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O'Brien turned away. He took a
    pace or two up and down. Then he continued less vehemently:

    'The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no
    martyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In
    the Middle Ages there was the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set out
    to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it
    burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because
    the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while
    they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were
    unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true
    beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame
    to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there
    were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis
    and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly
    than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned
    from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not
    make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they
    deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down
    by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches,
    confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with
    abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy.
    And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again.
    The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once
    again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they
    had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of
    that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make
    them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us.
    You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston.
    Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the
    stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the
    stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not
    a memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past as well
    as in the future. You will never have existed.'

    Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary
    bitterness. O'Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the
    thought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little
    narrowed.

    'You are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to destroy you utterly,
    so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference--in
    that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? That is
    what you were thinking, was it not?'

    'Yes,' said Winston.

    O'Brien smiled slightly. 'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are
    a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are
    different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with
    negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally
    you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy
    the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never
    destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him.
    We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our
    side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of
    ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous
    thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless
    it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In
    the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming
    his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could
    carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage
    waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it
    out. The command of the old despotisms was "Thou shalt not". The command
    of the totalitarians was "Thou shalt". Our command is "THOU ART". No one
    whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed
    clean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once
    believed--Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--in the end we broke them down.
    I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down,
    whimpering, grovelling, weeping--and in the end it was not with pain or
    fear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they were
    only the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for
    what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to see
    how they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die
    while their minds were still clean.'

    His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm,
    was still in his face. He is not pretending, thought Winston, he is not a
    hypocrite, he believes every word he says. What most oppressed him was the
    consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavy
    yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his
    vision. O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was no
    idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O'Brien had not long ago
    known, examined, and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston's mind. But
    in that case how could it be true that O'Brien was mad? It must be he,
    Winston, who was mad. O'Brien halted and looked down at him. His voice had
    grown stern again.

    'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely
    you surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared. And
    even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still
    you would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever.
    Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the point from
    which there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which you
    could not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you be
    capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you.
    Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living,
    or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow.
    We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.'

    He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Winston was aware of
    some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.
    O'Brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on a
    level with Winston's.

    'Three thousand,' he said, speaking over Winston's head to the man in the
    white coat.

    Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against
    Winston's temples. He quailed. There was pain coming, a new kind of pain.
    O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.

    'This time it will not hurt,' he said. 'Keep your eyes fixed on mine.'

    At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an
    explosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. There
    was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light. Winston was not hurt, only
    prostrated. Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing
    happened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that
    position. A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also something
    had happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus he
    remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that was
    gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of
    emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.

    'It will not last,' said O'Brien. 'Look me in the eyes. What country is
    Oceania at war with?'

    Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself was
    a citizen of Oceania. He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was
    at war with whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that there
    was any war.

    'I don't remember.'

    'Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Do you remember that now?'

    'Yes.'

    'Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since the beginning of your
    life, since the beginning of the Party, since the beginning of history,
    the war has continued without a break, always the same war. Do you
    remember that?'

    'Yes.'

    'Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been
    condemned to death for treachery. You pretended that you had seen a piece
    of paper which proved them innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed.
    You invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember now the
    very moment at which you first invented it. Do you remember that?'

    'Yes.'

    'Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You saw five fingers.
    Do you remember that?'

    'Yes.'

    O'Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed.

    'There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?'

    'Yes.'

    And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of his
    mind changed. He saw five fingers, and there was no deformity. Then
    everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the
    bewilderment came crowding back again. But there had been a moment--he did
    not know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps--of luminous certainty, when
    each new suggestion of O'Brien's had filled up a patch of emptiness and
    become absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three as
    easily as five, if that were what was needed. It had faded but before
    O'Brien had dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he
    could remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of
    one's life when one was in effect a different person.

    'You see now,' said O'Brien, 'that it is at any rate possible.'

    'Yes,' said Winston.

    O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left Winston saw the
    man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a
    syringe. O'Brien turned to Winston with a smile. In almost the old manner
    he resettled his spectacles on his nose.

    'Do you remember writing in your diary,' he said, 'that it did not matter
    whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person who
    understood you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to
    you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you
    happen to be insane. Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me
    a few questions, if you choose.'

    'Any question I like?'

    'Anything.' He saw that Winston's eyes were upon the dial. 'It is switched
    off. What is your first question?'

    'What have you done with Julia?' said Winston.

    O'Brien smiled again. 'She betrayed you, Winston. Immediately--unreservedly.
    I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. You would hardly
    recognize her if you saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her
    folly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her. It was
    a perfect conversion, a textbook case.'

    'You tortured her?'

    O'Brien left this unanswered. 'Next question,' he said.

    'Does Big Brother exist?'

    'Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the embodiment of
    the Party.'

    'Does he exist in the same way as I exist?'

    'You do not exist,' said O'Brien.

    Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, or he could
    imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were
    nonsense, they were only a play on words. Did not the statement, 'You do
    not exist', contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so?
    His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with
    which O'Brien would demolish him.

    'I think I exist,' he said wearily. 'I am conscious of my own identity.
    I was born and I shall die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particular
    point in space. No other solid object can occupy the same point
    simultaneously. In that sense, does Big Brother exist?'

    'It is of no importance. He exists.'

    'Will Big Brother ever die?'

    'Of course not. How could he die? Next question.'

    'Does the Brotherhood exist?'

    'That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set you free when we
    have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you
    will never learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No. As long
    as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'

    Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still had
    not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. He had got
    to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. There
    was a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed to
    wear an ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he knows what
    I am going to ask! At the thought the words burst out of him:

    'What is in Room 101?'

    The expression on O'Brien's face did not change. He answered drily:

    'You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone knows what is in
    Room 101.'

    He raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidently the session was
    at an end. A needle jerked into Winston's arm. He sank almost instantly
    into deep sleep.




    Chapter 3



    'There are three stages in your reintegration,' said O'Brien. 'There is
    learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It is time for
    you to enter upon the second stage.'

    As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds were
    looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a
    little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from
    the elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could
    evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he
    showed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through
    a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many
    sessions there had been. The whole process seemed to stretch out over a
    long, indefinite time--weeks, possibly--and the intervals between the
    sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.

    'As you lie there,' said O'Brien, 'you have often wondered--you have even
    asked me--why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble
    on you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially
    the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived
    in, but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary,
    "I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY"? It was when you thought about
    "why" that you doubted your own sanity. You have read THE BOOK,
    Goldstein's book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tell you anything that
    you did not know already?'

    'You have read it?' said Winston.

    'I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. No book is
    produced individually, as you know.'

    'Is it true, what it says?'

    'As description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secret
    accumulation of knowledge--a gradual spread of enlightenment--ultimately
    a proletarian rebellion--the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself
    that that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians will
    never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do
    not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever
    cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There
    is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is
    for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.'

    He came closer to the bed. 'For ever!' he repeated. 'And now let us get
    back to the question of "how" and "why". You understand well enough HOW
    the Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me WHY we cling to power.
    What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' he added as
    Winston remained silent.

    Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of
    weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come
    back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. That
    the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of
    the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail,
    cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and
    must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger
    than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and
    happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.
    That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect
    doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of
    others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that
    when O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face.
    O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what
    the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings
    lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had
    understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was
    justified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston,
    against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your
    arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?

    'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly. 'You believe
    that human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore----'

    He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body.
    O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.

    'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said. 'You should know better than
    to say a thing like that.'

    He pulled the lever back and continued:

    'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party
    seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good
    of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long
    life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will
    understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the
    past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who
    resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the
    Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never
    had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps
    they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a
    limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where
    human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that
    no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is
    not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order
    to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish
    the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of
    torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to
    understand me?'

    Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of
    O'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of
    intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself
    helpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin
    sagged from the cheekbones. O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing
    the worn face nearer.

    'You are thinking,' he said, 'that my face is old and tired. You are
    thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent the
    decay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual
    is only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism.
    Do you die when you cut your fingernails?'

    He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one hand
    in his pocket.

    'We are the priests of power,' he said. 'God is power. But at present
    power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to
    gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realize
    is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as
    he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: "Freedom is
    Slavery". Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is
    freedom. Alone--free--the human being is always defeated. It must be so,
    because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all
    failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape
    from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS the
    Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to
    realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body--but, above
    all, over the mind. Power over matter--external reality, as you would call
    it--is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute.'

    For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise
    himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his
    body painfully.

    'But how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'You don't even control
    the climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death----'

    O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'We control matter because
    we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn by
    degrees, Winston. There is nothing that we could not do. Invisibility,
    levitation--anything. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if
    I wish to. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You must
    get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature. We
    make the laws of Nature.'

    'But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What about
    Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet.'

    'Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not,
    what difference would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceania
    is the world.'

    'But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny--helpless!
    How long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was
    uninhabited.'

    'Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older?
    Nothing exists except through human consciousness.'

    'But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals--mammoths and
    mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever
    heard of.'

    'Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-century
    biologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if he
    could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is
    nothing.'

    'But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of them are
    a million light-years away. They are out of our reach for ever.'

    'What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They are bits of fire
    a few kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could
    blot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the
    stars go round it.'

    Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say
    anything. O'Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection:

    'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the
    ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to
    assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions
    upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is
    beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near
    or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians
    are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?'

    Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer
    crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he KNEW, that he was in the
    right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind--surely there
    must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been
    exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he
    had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of O'Brien's mouth as
    he looked down at him.

    'I told you, Winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is not your strong
    point. The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are
    mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But
    that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a
    digression,' he added in a different tone. 'The real power, the power we
    have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.'
    He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster
    questioning a promising pupil: 'How does one man assert his power over
    another, Winston?'

    Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.

    'Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is
    suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his
    own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing
    human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of
    your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are
    creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that
    the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a
    world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not
    less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will
    be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they
    were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world
    there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.
    Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down
    the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We
    have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and
    between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend
    any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends.
    Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from
    a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual
    formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm.
    Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except
    loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of
    Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over
    a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When
    we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be
    no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity,
    no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be
    destroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be
    the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing
    subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory,
    the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a
    picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'

    He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to
    shrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything.
    His heart seemed to be frozen. O'Brien went on:

    'And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to be
    stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so
    that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you
    have undergone since you have been in our hands--all that will continue,
    and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the
    executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of
    terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the
    less it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter the
    despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at
    every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and
    yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you
    during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after
    generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here
    at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible--and in the end
    utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own
    accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of
    victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless
    pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning,
    I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you
    will do more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, become
    part of it.'

    Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak. 'You can't!' he said
    weakly.

    'What do you mean by that remark, Winston?'

    'You could not create such a world as you have just described. It is a
    dream. It is impossible.'

    'Why?'

    'It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty.
    It would never endure.'

    'Why not?'

    'It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would commit
    suicide.'

    'Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting
    than love. Why should it be? And if it were, what difference would that
    make? Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that we
    quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what
    difference would it make? Can you not understand that the death of the
    individual is not death? The party is immortal.'

    As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover he
    was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement O'Brien would twist
    the dial again. And yet he could not keep silent. Feebly, without
    arguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of
    what O'Brien had said, he returned to the attack.

    'I don't know--I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat
    you. Life will defeat you.'

    'We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imagining that there
    is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and
    will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely
    malleable. Or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the
    proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out of your
    mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity is the Party. The
    others are outside--irrelevant.'

    'I don't care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later they will
    see you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces.'

    'Do you see any evidence that that is happening? Or any reason why it
    should?'

    'No. I believe it. I KNOW that you will fail. There is something in the
    universe--I don't know, some spirit, some principle--that you will never
    overcome.'

    'Do you believe in God, Winston?'

    'No.'

    'Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?'

    'I don't know. The spirit of Man.'

    'And do you consider yourself a man?'

    'Yes.'

    'If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we
    are the inheritors. Do you understand that you are ALONE? You are outside
    history, you are non-existent.' His manner changed and he said more
    harshly: 'And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our lies
    and our cruelty?'

    'Yes, I consider myself superior.'

    O'Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. After a moment
    Winston recognized one of them as his own. It was a sound-track of the
    conversation he had had with O'Brien, on the night when he had enrolled
    himself in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal,
    to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to
    disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child's face. O'Brien
    made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration
    was hardly worth making. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.

    'Get up from that bed,' he said.

    The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered himself to the floor
    and stood up unsteadily.

    'You are the last man,' said O'Brien. 'You are the guardian of the human
    spirit. You shall see yourself as you are. Take off your clothes.'

    Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. The zip
    fastener had long since been wrenched out of them. He could not remember
    whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at
    one time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish
    rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid
    them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far
    end of the room. He approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry
    had broken out of him.

    'Go on,' said O'Brien. 'Stand between the wings of the mirror. You shall
    see the side view as well.'

    He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, grey-coloured,
    skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was
    frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He
    moved closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded,
    because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby
    forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and
    battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful.
    The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was
    his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had
    changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the
    ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he had
    thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was
    grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all
    over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there
    were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an
    inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening
    thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow
    as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker
    than the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant about seeing the side
    view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders were
    hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck
    seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he
    would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from
    some malignant disease.

    'You have thought sometimes,' said O'Brien, 'that my face--the face of a
    member of the Inner Party--looks old and worn. What do you think of your
    own face?'

    He seized Winston's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him.

    'Look at the condition you are in!' he said. 'Look at this filthy grime
    all over your body. Look at the dirt between your toes. Look at that
    disgusting running sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink like a
    goat? Probably you have ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do
    you see? I can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. I could
    snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost twenty-five
    kilograms since you have been in our hands? Even your hair is coming out
    in handfuls. Look!' He plucked at Winston's head and brought away a tuft
    of hair. 'Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many had you
    when you came to us? And the few you have left are dropping out of your
    head. Look here!'

    He seized one of Winston's remaining front teeth between his powerful
    thumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain shot through Winston's jaw. O'Brien
    had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the
    cell.

    'You are rotting away,' he said; 'you are falling to pieces. What are you?
    A bag of filth. Now turn around and look into that mirror again. Do you
    see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that is
    humanity. Now put your clothes on again.'

    Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. Until now he had
    not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. Only one thought stirred in
    his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined.
    Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of
    pity for his ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing
    he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst
    into tears. He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of
    bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but
    he could not stop himself. O'Brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almost
    kindly.

    'It will not last for ever,' he said. 'You can escape from it whenever you
    choose. Everything depends on yourself.'

    'You did it!' sobbed Winston. 'You reduced me to this state.'

    'No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you accepted when
    you set yourself up against the Party. It was all contained in that first
    act. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.'

    He paused, and then went on:

    'We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen what
    your body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there
    can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and
    insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in
    your own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed
    everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that has
    not happened to you?'

    Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his
    eyes. He looked up at O'Brien.

    'I have not betrayed Julia,' he said.

    O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'No,' he said; 'no; that is
    perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.'

    The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy,
    flooded Winston's heart again. How intelligent, he thought, how
    intelligent! Never did O'Brien fail to understand what was said to him.
    Anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he HAD betrayed
    Julia. For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the
    torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her
    character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail
    everything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said to
    her and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, their
    vague plottings against the Party--everything. And yet, in the sense in
    which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. He had not stopped
    loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. O'Brien had
    seen what he meant without the need for explanation.

    'Tell me,' he said, 'how soon will they shoot me?'

    'It might be a long time,' said O'Brien. 'You are a difficult case. But
    don't give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or later. In the end we shall
    shoot you.'




    Chapter 4



    He was much better. He was growing fatter and stronger every day, if it
    was proper to speak of days.

    The white light and the humming sound were the same as ever, but the cell
    was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. There was a
    pillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had
    given him a bath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently
    in a tin basin. They even gave him warm water to wash with. They had given
    him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls. They had dressed his
    varicose ulcer with soothing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants
    of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures.

    Weeks or months must have passed. It would have been possible now to keep
    count of the passage of time, if he had felt any interest in doing so,
    since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. He was
    getting, he judged, three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he
    wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. The food
    was surprisingly good, with meat at every third meal. Once there was even
    a packet of cigarettes. He had no matches, but the never-speaking guard
    who brought his food would give him a light. The first time he tried to
    smoke it made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out for
    a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.

    They had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the
    corner. At first he made no use of it. Even when he was awake he was
    completely torpid. Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost
    without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries
    in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown
    used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed to make no
    difference, except that one's dreams were more coherent. He dreamed a
    great deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. He
    was in the Golden Country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious,
    sunlit ruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O'Brien--not doing
    anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. Such
    thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. He
    seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the
    stimulus of pain had been removed. He was not bored, he had no desire
    for conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten
    or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was
    completely satisfying.

    By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no
    impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the
    strength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there,
    trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were
    growing rounder and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a
    doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker
    than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he began exercising
    himself regularly. In a little while he could walk three kilometres,
    measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing
    straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and
    humiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of a
    walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand
    on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and found
    that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to
    a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight
    by his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre.
    But after a few more days--a few more mealtimes--even that feat was
    accomplished. A time came when he could do it six times running. He began
    to grow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief
    that his face also was growing back to normal. Only when he chanced to put
    his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face that
    had looked back at him out of the mirror.

    His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank bed, his back against
    the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at the
    task of re-educating himself.

    He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw now, he had
    been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. From the
    moment when he was inside the Ministry of Love--and yes, even during those
    minutes when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the
    telescreen told them what to do--he had grasped the frivolity, the
    shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the
    Party. He knew now that for seven years the Thought Police had watched him
    like a beetle under a magnifying glass. There was no physical act, no word
    spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they had
    not been able to infer. Even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his
    diary they had carefully replaced. They had played sound-tracks to him,
    shown him photographs. Some of them were photographs of Julia and himself.
    Yes, even... He could not fight against the Party any longer. Besides,
    the Party was in the right. It must be so; how could the immortal,
    collective brain be mistaken? By what external standard could you check
    its judgements? Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question of
    learning to think as they thought. Only----!

    The pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He began to write down
    the thoughts that came into his head. He wrote first in large clumsy
    capitals:


    FREEDOM IS SLAVERY


    Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:


    TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE


    But then there came a sort of check. His mind, as though shying away from
    something, seemed unable to concentrate. He knew that he knew what came
    next, but for the moment he could not recall it. When he did recall it,
    it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not come
    of its own accord. He wrote:


    GOD IS POWER


    He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past never had been
    altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war
    with Eastasia. Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes
    they were charged with. He had never seen the photograph that disproved
    their guilt. It had never existed, he had invented it. He remembered
    remembering contrary things, but those were false memories, products of
    self-deception. How easy it all was! Only surrender, and everything else
    followed. It was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards
    however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and
    go with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except
    your own attitude: the predestined thing happened in any case. He hardly
    knew why he had ever rebelled. Everything was easy, except----!

    Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The
    law of gravity was nonsense. 'If I wished,' O'Brien had said, 'I could
    float off this floor like a soap bubble.' Winston worked it out. 'If he
    THINKS he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I see him
    do it, then the thing happens.' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage
    breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'It doesn't
    really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.' He pushed the thought
    under instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere
    or other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' world where 'real' things
    happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of
    anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind.
    Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.

    He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no danger
    of succumbing to it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought never to
    have occurred to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a
    dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic,
    instinctive. CRIMESTOP, they called it in Newspeak.

    He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with
    propositions--'the Party says the earth is flat', 'the party says that
    ice is heavier than water'--and trained himself in not seeing or not
    understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy.
    It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical
    problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as 'two and two make
    five' were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort of
    athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate
    use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical
    errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to
    attain.

    All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would
    shoot him. 'Everything depends on yourself,' O'Brien had said; but he knew
    that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. It
    might be ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him for years in
    solitary confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they might
    release him for a while, as they sometimes did. It was perfectly possible
    that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation
    would be enacted all over again. The one certain thing was that death
    never came at an expected moment. The tradition--the unspoken tradition:
    somehow you knew it, though you never heard it said--was that they shot
    you from behind; always in the back of the head, without warning, as you
    walked down a corridor from cell to cell.

    One day--but 'one day' was not the right expression; just as probably it
    was in the middle of the night: once--he fell into a strange, blissful
    reverie. He was walking down the corridor, waiting for the bullet. He knew
    that it was coming in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothed
    out, reconciled. There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no more
    pain, no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily,
    with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was
    not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, he
    was in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, down which he had
    seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He was in the Golden
    Country, following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture.
    He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine
    on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly stirring,
    and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green
    pools under the willows.

    Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The sweat broke out on his
    backbone. He had heard himself cry aloud:

    'Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!'

    For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence. She
    had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. It was as though she
    had got into the texture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her far
    more than he had ever done when they were together and free. Also he knew
    that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.

    He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. What had he done? How
    many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness?

    In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. They could not
    let such an outburst go unpunished. They would know now, if they had not
    known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them.
    He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had
    hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had
    retreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped
    to keep the inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but
    he preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand that--O'Brien would
    understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.

    He would have to start all over again. It might take years. He ran a hand
    over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. There
    were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose
    flattened. Besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been
    given a complete new set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve
    inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. In any
    case, mere control of the features was not enough. For the first time he
    perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from
    yourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but until it is
    needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape
    that could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right;
    he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred
    locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and
    yet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst.

    One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would
    happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. It
    was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be
    enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then
    suddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the
    changing of a line in his face--suddenly the camouflage would be down and
    bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an
    enormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go the
    bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown his brain to pieces
    before they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be unpunished,
    unrepented, out of their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole in
    their own perfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.

    He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an intellectual
    discipline. It was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. He
    had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. What was the most horrible,
    sickening thing of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face
    (because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as
    being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that
    followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord.
    What were his true feelings towards Big Brother?

    There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The steel door swung open
    with a clang. O'Brien walked into the cell. Behind him were the waxen-faced
    officer and the black-uniformed guards.

    'Get up,' said O'Brien. 'Come here.'

    Winston stood opposite him. O'Brien took Winston's shoulders between his
    strong hands and looked at him closely.

    'You have had thoughts of deceiving me,' he said. 'That was stupid.
    Stand up straighter. Look me in the face.'

    He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:

    'You are improving. Intellectually there is very little wrong with you.
    It is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress. Tell me,
    Winston--and remember, no lies: you know that I am always able to detect
    a lie--tell me, what are your true feelings towards Big Brother?'

    'I hate him.'

    'You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you to take the last step.
    You must love Big Brother. It is not enough to obey him: you must love
    him.'

    He released Winston with a little push towards the guards.

    'Room 101,' he said.




    Chapter 5



    At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know,
    whereabouts he was in the windowless building. Possibly there were slight
    differences in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had beaten him
    were below ground level. The room where he had been interrogated by
    O'Brien was high up near the roof. This place was many metres underground,
    as deep down as it was possible to go.

    It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed
    his surroundings. All he noticed was that there were two small tables
    straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a
    metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was
    strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not
    even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him to
    look straight in front of him.

    For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and O'Brien came in.

    'You asked me once,' said O'Brien, 'what was in Room 101. I told you that
    you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is in
    Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.'

    The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire,
    a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table. Because
    of the position in which O'Brien was standing. Winston could not see what
    the thing was.

    'The worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, 'varies from individual to
    individual. It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, or
    by impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is some
    quite trivial thing, not even fatal.'

    He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of
    the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top
    for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked
    like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three
    or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided
    lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature
    in each. They were rats.

    'In your case,' said O'Brien, 'the worst thing in the world happens to be
    rats.'

    A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had
    passed through Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage.
    But at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it
    suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water.

    'You can't do that!' he cried out in a high cracked voice. 'You couldn't,
    you couldn't! It's impossible.'

    'Do you remember,' said O'Brien, 'the moment of panic that used to occur
    in your dreams? There was a wall of blackness in front of you, and a
    roaring sound in your ears. There was something terrible on the other side
    of the wall. You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it
    into the open. It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.'

    'O'Brien!' said Winston, making an effort to control his voice. 'You know
    this is not necessary. What is it that you want me to do?'

    O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish
    manner that he sometimes affected. He looked thoughtfully into the
    distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind
    Winston's back.

    'By itself,' he said, 'pain is not always enough. There are occasions when
    a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death.
    But for everyone there is something unendurable--something that cannot be
    contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling
    from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up
    from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. It is
    merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same with the
    rats. For you, they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that you
    cannot withstand, even if you wished to. You will do what is required of
    you.'

    'But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don't know what it is?'

    O'Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table.
    He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston could hear the blood
    singing in his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness.
    He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with
    sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances.
    Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They were
    enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt and
    fierce and his fur brown instead of grey.

    'The rat,' said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible audience,
    'although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will have
    heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In some
    streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five
    minutes. The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time they
    will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying people. They
    show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless.'

    There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winston
    from far away. The rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each
    other through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of despair.
    That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.

    O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it.
    There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear himself
    loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head,
    was held immovably. O'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a
    metre from Winston's face.

    'I have pressed the first lever,' said O'Brien. 'You understand the
    construction of this cage. The mask will fit over your head, leaving no
    exit. When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up.
    These starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever
    seen a rat leap through the air? They will leap on to your face and bore
    straight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes they
    burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue.'

    The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession of
    shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. But
    he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a
    split second left--to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty
    odour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of
    nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had gone
    black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out
    of the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one way to save
    himself. He must interpose another human being, the BODY of another human
    being, between himself and the rats.

    The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of
    anything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. The
    rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, the
    other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink
    hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see
    the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him.
    He was blind, helpless, mindless.

    'It was a common punishment in Imperial China,' said O'Brien as
    didactically as ever.

    The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then--no,
    it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps
    too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was
    just ONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment--ONE body that he
    could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically,
    over and over.

    'Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do
    to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!'

    He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He was
    still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through
    the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through
    the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars--always
    away, away, away from the rats. He was light years distant, but O'Brien
    was still standing at his side. There was still the cold touch of wire
    against his cheek. But through the darkness that enveloped him he heard
    another metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and
    not open.




    Chapter 6



    The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight slanting through a
    window fell on dusty table-tops. It was the lonely hour of fifteen. A
    tinny music trickled from the telescreens.

    Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and again
    he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall.
    BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and
    filled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from
    another bottle with a quill through the cork. It was saccharine flavoured
    with cloves, the speciality of the cafe.

    Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present only music was coming
    out of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be
    a special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace. The news from the African
    front was disquieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worrying
    about it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia:
    Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) was moving southward at
    terrifying speed. The mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite
    area, but it was probable that already the mouth of the Congo was a
    battlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in danger. One did not have
    to look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely a question of
    losing Central Africa: for the first time in the whole war, the territory
    of Oceania itself was menaced.

    A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated
    excitement, flared up in him, then faded again. He stopped thinking about
    the war. In these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for
    more than a few moments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained it
    at a gulp. As always, the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly.
    The stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting
    enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; and
    what was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him
    night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of
    those----

    He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible
    he never visualized them. They were something that he was half-aware of,
    hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin
    rose in him he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they
    released him, and had regained his old colour--indeed, more than regained
    it. His features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was
    coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again
    unbidden, brought the chessboard and the current issue of 'The Times',
    with the page turned down at the chess problem. Then, seeing that Winston's
    glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was no
    need to give orders. They knew his habits. The chessboard was always
    waiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when the place
    was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too
    close to him. He never even bothered to count his drinks. At irregular
    intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said
    was the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him.
    It would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. He
    had always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, more
    highly-paid than his old job had been.

    The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. Winston raised
    his head to listen. No bulletins from the front, however. It was merely a
    brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter,
    it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan's quota for bootlaces had been
    overfulfilled by 98 per cent.

    He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky
    ending, involving a couple of knights. 'White to play and mate in two
    moves.' Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always
    mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without
    exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of
    the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying
    triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm
    power. White always mates.

    The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much
    graver tone: 'You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at
    fifteen-thirty. Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest importance.
    Take care not to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!' The tinkling music struck up
    again.

    Winston's heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instinct
    told him that it was bad news that was coming. All day, with little spurts
    of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and
    out of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming
    across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa
    like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank them in
    some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in his
    mind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. THERE
    was the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward he
    saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear,
    cutting their communications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he
    was bringing that other force into existence. But it was necessary to act
    quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they had
    airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It
    might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the
    destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medley
    of feeling--but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive
    layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was
    undermost--struggled inside him.

    The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for the
    moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem.
    His thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with his
    finger in the dust on the table:

    2+2=5

    'They can't get inside you,' she had said. But they could get inside you.
    'What happens to you here is FOR EVER,' O'Brien had said. That was a true
    word. There were things, your own acts, from which you could never recover.
    Something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.

    He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was no danger in it. He
    knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his
    doings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them
    had wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the
    Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and
    all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few
    crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He
    was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not
    ten metres away from him. It struck him at once that she had changed in
    some ill-defined way. They almost passed one another without a sign, then
    he turned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was no
    danger, nobody would take any interest in him. She did not speak. She
    walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him,
    then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently they
    were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for
    concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was vilely
    cold. The wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional,
    dirty-looking crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.

    There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones: besides,
    they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered. They could have
    lain down on the ground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His flesh
    froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to
    the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew
    now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long
    scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that
    was not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a
    surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion
    of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and
    had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by
    its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone
    than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture
    of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been.

    He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked back
    across the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time. It
    was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered
    whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it
    was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept
    squeezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by side
    but not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak. She moved
    her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig. Her
    feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.

    'I betrayed you,' she said baldly.

    'I betrayed you,' he said.

    She gave him another quick look of dislike.

    'Sometimes,' she said, 'they threaten you with something something you
    can't stand up to, can't even think about. And then you say, "Don't do it
    to me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so." And perhaps you might
    pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to
    make them stop and didn't really mean it. But that isn't true. At the time
    when it happens you do mean it. You think there's no other way of saving
    yourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way. You WANT it to
    happen to the other person. You don't give a damn what they suffer. All
    you care about is yourself.'

    'All you care about is yourself,' he echoed.

    'And after that, you don't feel the same towards the other person any
    longer.'

    'No,' he said, 'you don't feel the same.'

    There did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind plastered their
    thin overalls against their bodies. Almost at once it became embarrassing
    to sit there in silence: besides, it was too cold to keep still. She said
    something about catching her Tube and stood up to go.

    'We must meet again,' he said.

    'Yes,' she said, 'we must meet again.'

    He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her.
    They did not speak again. She did not actually try to shake him off, but
    walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her.
    He had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube
    station, but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed
    pointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to
    get away from Julia as to get back to the Chestnut Tree Cafe, which had
    never seemed so attractive as at this moment. He had a nostalgic vision
    of his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the
    ever-flowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The next moment,
    not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become separated from
    her by a small knot of people. He made a half-hearted attempt to catch up,
    then slowed down, turned, and made off in the opposite direction. When he
    had gone fifty metres he looked back. The street was not crowded, but
    already he could not distinguish her. Any one of a dozen hurrying figures
    might have been hers. Perhaps her thickened, stiffened body was no longer
    recognizable from behind.

    'At the time when it happens,' she had said, 'you do mean it.' He had
    meant it. He had not merely said it, he had wished it. He had wished that
    she and not he should be delivered over to the----

    Something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen. A
    cracked and jeering note, a yellow note, came into it. And then--perhaps
    it was not happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance
    of sound--a voice was singing:


    'Under the spreading chestnut tree
    I sold you and you sold me----'


    The tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed that his glass
    was empty and came back with the gin bottle.

    He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not less but more
    horrible with every mouthful he drank. But it had become the element he
    swam in. It was his life, his death, and his resurrection. It was gin that
    sank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning.
    When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids and
    fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it would have been
    impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the
    bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight. Through the midday
    hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, listening to the
    telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the Chestnut
    Tree. No one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, no
    telescreen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went
    to a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth and did
    a little work, or what was called work. He had been appointed to a
    sub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of the
    innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the
    compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They were
    engaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it was
    that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out. It was
    something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed
    inside brackets, or outside. There were four others on the committee, all
    of them persons similar to himself. There were days when they assembled
    and then promptly dispersed again, frankly admitting to one another that
    there was not really anything to be done. But there were other days when
    they settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show
    of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never
    finished--when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about
    grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over
    definitions, enormous digressions, quarrels--threats, even, to appeal to
    higher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out of them and
    they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes,
    like ghosts fading at cock-crow.

    The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his head again. The
    bulletin! But no, they were merely changing the music. He had the map of
    Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: a
    black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontally
    eastward, across the tail of the first. As though for reassurance he
    looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it conceivable
    that the second arrow did not even exist?

    His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful of gin, picked up
    the white knight and made a tentative move. Check. But it was evidently
    not the right move, because----

    Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a candle-lit room with a
    vast white-counterpaned bed, and himself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on
    the floor, shaking a dice-box, and laughing excitedly. His mother was
    sitting opposite him and also laughing.

    It must have been about a month before she disappeared. It was a moment of
    reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his
    earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. He remembered the day
    well, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the window-pane
    and the light indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the two
    children in the dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable. Winston whined
    and grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling
    everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours
    banged on the wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently. In the
    end his mother said, 'Now be good, and I'll buy you a toy. A lovely
    toy--you'll love it'; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little
    general shop which was still sporadically open nearby, and came back with
    a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and Ladders. He could still
    remember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The
    board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they
    would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the thing sulkily and
    without interest. But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat
    down on the floor to play. Soon he was wildly excited and shouting with
    laughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then
    came slithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting-point. They
    played eight games, winning four each. His tiny sister, too young to
    understand what the game was about, had sat propped up against a bolster,
    laughing because the others were laughing. For a whole afternoon they had
    all been happy together, as in his earlier childhood.

    He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a false memory. He was
    troubled by false memories occasionally. They did not matter so long as
    one knew them for what they were. Some things had happened, others had not
    happened. He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight
    again. Almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a
    clatter. He had started as though a pin had run into him.

    A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the bulletin! Victory!
    It always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news. A sort of
    electric drill ran through the cafe. Even the waiters had started and
    pricked up their ears.

    The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise. Already an
    excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it started
    it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. The news had
    run round the streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what was
    issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as he had
    foreseen; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in
    the enemy's rear, the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black.
    Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: 'Vast
    strategic manoeuvre--perfect co-ordination--utter rout--half a million
    prisoners--complete demoralization--control of the whole of Africa--bring
    the war within measurable distance of its end--victory--greatest victory
    in human history--victory, victory, victory!'

    Under the table Winston's feet made convulsive movements. He had not
    stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running,
    he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again
    at the portrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world!
    The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! He
    thought how ten minutes ago--yes, only ten minutes--there had still been
    equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front
    would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army that
    had perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry
    of Love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened,
    until this moment.

    The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners
    and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little.
    The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached with
    the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention
    as his glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer. He
    was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul white
    as snow. He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating
    everybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling
    of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The long-hoped-for
    bullet was entering his brain.

    He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn
    what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. O cruel, needless
    misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast!
    Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all
    right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won
    the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.



    THE END



    APPENDIX.

    The Principles of Newspeak



    Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet
    the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984
    there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of
    communication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in
    'The Times' were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could
    only be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would
    have finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should
    call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all
    Party members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions
    more and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and
    embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was
    a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic
    formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final,
    perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary,
    that we are concerned here.

    The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression
    for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc,
    but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that
    when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,
    a heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles of
    Ingsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is
    dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and
    often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could
    properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the
    possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly
    by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable
    words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and
    so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single
    example. The word FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be
    used in such statements as 'This dog is free from lice' or 'This field is
    free from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of 'politically
    free' or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom no
    longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.
    Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction
    of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be
    dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend
    but to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly
    assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.

    Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though
    many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,
    would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak
    words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary,
    the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary.
    It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical
    peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to
    the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.


    THE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the
    business of everyday life--for such things as eating, drinking, working,
    putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles,
    gardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words
    that we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE,
    FIELD--but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their
    number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly
    defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of
    them. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was
    simply a staccato sound expressing ONE clearly understood concept. It
    would have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary
    purposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intended
    only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete
    objects or physical actions.

    The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of
    these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of
    speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very
    abstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun,
    adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were
    of the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself
    involving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, for
    example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by THINK, which
    did duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed
    here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention,
    in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning
    were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently
    suppressed. There was, for example, no such word as CUT, its meaning being
    sufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by
    adding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE. Thus
    for example, SPEEDFUL meant 'rapid' and SPEEDWISE meant 'quickly'. Certain
    of our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT,
    were retained, but their total number was very small. There was little
    need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by
    adding -FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained,
    except for a very few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination was
    invariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.

    In addition, any word--this again applied in principle to every word in
    the language--could be negatived by adding the affix UN-, or could be
    strengthened by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis,
    DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example, UNCOLD meant 'warm', while PLUSCOLD and
    DOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, 'very cold' and 'superlatively cold'.
    It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of
    almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-,
    etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous
    diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was no
    need for such a word as BAD, since the required meaning was equally
    well--indeed, better--expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in any
    case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide
    which of them to suppress. DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT,
    or LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.

    The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.
    Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions
    followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past
    participle were the same and ended in -ED. The preterite of STEAL was
    STEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so on throughout the
    language, all such forms as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being
    abolished. All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might be.
    The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES. Comparison of
    adjectives was invariably made by adding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST),
    irregular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being suppressed.

    The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly
    were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the
    auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that
    WHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had
    been dropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD. There were
    also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for
    rapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable
    to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally
    therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word
    or an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt
    chiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary. WHY so great an importance was
    attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.


    THE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been
    deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say,
    which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended
    to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without
    a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use
    these words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into
    Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually
    demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain
    overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing
    whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more
    accurate and forcible than ordinary language.

    The B words were in all cases compound words. [Compound words such as
    SPEAKWRITE, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were
    merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.]
    They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together
    in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a
    noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single
    example: the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, if
    one chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'. This
    inflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK; past tense and past participle,
    GOODTHINKED; present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOODTHINKFUL;
    adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, GOODTHINKER.

    The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of
    which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed
    in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce
    while indicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime),
    for instance, the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police)
    it came first, and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.
    Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations
    were commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example,
    the adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,
    MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because -TRUEFUL,
    -PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle,
    however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the
    same way.

    Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to
    anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example,
    such a typical sentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERS
    UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could make of this
    in Oldspeak would be: 'Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution
    cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English
    Socialism.' But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, in
    order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above,
    one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by INGSOC. And in
    addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate
    the full force of the word BELLYFEEL, which implied a blind, enthusiastic
    acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word OLDTHINK, which was
    inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the
    special function of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK was one,
    was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words,
    necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they
    contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were
    sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped
    and forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak
    Dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make
    sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words
    they cancelled by their existence.

    As we have already seen in the case of the word FREE, words which had
    once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of
    convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them.
    Countless other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY, INTERNATIONALISM,
    DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and RELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket
    words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words
    grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for
    instance, were contained in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all words
    grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism
    were contained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater precision would have
    been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar
    to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that
    all nations other than his own worshipped 'false gods'. He did not need to
    know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the
    like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy.
    He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that
    all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat
    the same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in
    exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from
    it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by
    the two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity).
    SEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication,
    adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal
    intercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate
    them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle,
    all punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific
    and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to
    certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them.
    He knew what was meant by GOODSEX--that is to say, normal intercourse
    between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and
    without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was SEXCRIME.
    In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further
    than the perception that it WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessary
    words were nonexistent.

    No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were
    euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) or
    MINIPAX (Ministry of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact
    opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand,
    displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of
    Oceanic society. An example was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy
    entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses.
    Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation 'good' when
    applied to the Party and 'bad' when applied to its enemies. But in
    addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared
    to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not
    from their meaning, but from their structure.

    So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have
    political significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary. The
    name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or
    institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar
    shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number
    of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. In the Ministry
    of Truth, for example, the Records Department, in which Winston Smith
    worked, was called RECDEP, the Fiction Department was called FICDEP, the
    Teleprogrammes Department was called TELEDEP, and so on. This was not
    done solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early decades of
    the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the
    characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed
    that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in
    totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such
    words as NAZI, GESTAPO, COMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the beginning
    the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak
    it was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus
    abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by
    cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it.
    The words COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up a composite
    picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx,
    and the Paris Commune. The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests
    merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine.
    It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in
    purpose, as a chair or a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be uttered
    almost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase
    over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way,
    the associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and more
    controllable than those called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not
    only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the
    almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily
    pronounceable.

    In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude
    of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it
    seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for
    political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which
    could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the
    speaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from
    the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably
    these words--GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC,
    BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, and countless others--were words of two or three
    syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable
    and the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at
    once staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The
    intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not
    ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.
    For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes
    necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to
    make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the
    correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets.
    His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost
    foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound
    and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of
    Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.

    So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our
    own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were
    constantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other
    languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every
    year. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice,
    the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to
    make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher
    brain centres at all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word
    DUCKSPEAK, meaning 'to quack like a duck'. Like various other words in
    the B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the
    opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but
    praise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators of the Party
    as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.


    THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and
    consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the
    scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots,
    but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of
    undesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the
    words in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had any
    currency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific
    worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted
    to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the
    words occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to
    all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science
    as a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular
    branches. There was, indeed, no word for 'Science', any meaning that it
    could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.

    From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression
    of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.
    It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a
    species of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say
    BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely
    conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by
    reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas
    inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form,
    and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and
    condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.
    One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by
    illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For
    example, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only
    in the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak
    sentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed
    a palpable untruth--i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or
    strength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this
    secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word EQUAL.
    In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication,
    the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might
    remember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for
    any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within
    a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have
    vanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no
    more know that EQUAL had once had the secondary meaning of 'politically
    equal', or that FREE had once meant 'intellectually free', than for
    instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the
    secondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would be many
    crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply
    because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be
    foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics
    of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced--its words growing
    fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of
    putting them to improper uses always diminishing.

    When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with
    the past would have been severed. History had already been rewritten,
    but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there,
    imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one's knowledge of
    Oldspeak it was possible to read them. In the future such fragments, even
    if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable.
    It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless
    it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday
    action, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeak
    expression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written before
    approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary
    literature could only be subjected to ideological translation--that is,
    alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-known
    passage from the Declaration of Independence:


    WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,
    THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS,
    THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.
    THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN,
    DERIVING THEIR POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. THAT WHENEVER
    ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THOSE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT
    OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT...


    It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while
    keeping to the sense of the original. The nearest one could come to doing
    so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word CRIMETHINK.
    A full translation could only be an ideological translation, whereby
    Jefferson's words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.

    A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being
    transformed in this way. Considerations of prestige made it desirable to
    preserve the memory of certain historical figures, while at the same time
    bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc.
    Various writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and
    some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had
    been completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of
    the literature of the past, would be destroyed. These translations were
    a slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they would
    be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first
    century. There were also large quantities of merely utilitarian
    literature--indispensable technical manuals, and the like--that had to
    be treated in the same way. It was chiefly in order to allow time for
    the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of Newspeak
    had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.

    THE STORY BEHIND THE "FOUNDATION"

    By ISAAC ASIMOV


    The date was August 1, 1941. World War II had been raging for two years. France had fallen, the Battle
    of Britain had been fought, and the Soviet Union had just been invaded by Nazi Germany. The bombing
    of Pearl Harbor was four months in the future.

    But on that day, with Europe in flames, and the evil shadow of Adolf Hitler apparently falling over all
    the world, what was chiefly on my mind was a meeting toward which I was hastening.

    I was 2 1 years old, a graduate student in chemistry at Columbia University, and I had been writing
    science fiction professionally for three years. In that time, I had sold five stories to John Campbell, editor
    of Astounding, and the fifth story, "Nightfall," was about to appear in the September 1941 issue of the
    magazine. I had an appointment to see Mr. Campbell to tell him the plot of a new story I was planning to
    write, and the catch was that I had no plot in mind, not the trace of one.

    I therefore tried a device I sometimes use. I opened a book at random and set up free association,
    beginning with whatever I first saw. The book I had with me was a collection of the Gilbert and Sullivan
    plays. I happened to open it to the picture of the Fairy Queen of lolanthe throwing herself at the feet of
    Private Willis. I thought of soldiers, of military empires, of the Roman Empire - of a Galactic Empire -
    aha!

    Why shouldn't I write of the fall of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism, written from the
    viewpoint of someone in the secure days of the Second Galactic Empire? After all, I had read Gibbon's


    Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire not once, but twice.

    I was bubbling over by the time I got to Campbell's, and my enthusiasm must have been catching for
    Campbell blazed up as I had never seen him do. In the course of an hour we built up the notion of a vast
    series of connected stories that were to deal in intricate detail with the thousand-year period between the
    First and Second Galactic Empires. This was to be illuminated by the science of psychohistory, which
    Campbell and I thrashed out between us.

    On August 11, 1941, therefore, I began the story of that interregnum and called it "Foundation." In it, I
    described how the psychohistorian, Hari Seldon, established a pair of Foundations at opposite ends of the
    Universe under such circumstances as to make sure that the forces of history would bring about the
    second Empire after one thousand years instead of the thirty thousand that would be required otherwise.

    The story was submitted on September 8 and, to make sure that Campbell really meant what he said
    about a series, I ended "Foundation" on a cliff-hanger. Thus, it seemed to me, he would b e forced to buy
    a second story.

    However, when I started the second story (on October 24), I found that I had outsmarted myself. I
    quickly wrote myself into an impasse, and the Foundation series would have died an ignominious death
    had I not had a conversation with Fred Pohl on November 2 (on the Brooklyn Bridge, as it happened). I
    don't remember what Fred actually said, but, whatever it was, it pulled me out of the hole.

    "Foundation" appeared in the May 1942 issue of As founding and the succeeding story, "Bridle and
    Saddle," in the June 1942 issue.

    After that there was only the routine trouble of writing the stories. Through the remainder of the decade,
    John Campbell kept my nose to the grindstone and made sure he got additional Foundation stories.

    "The Big and the Little" was in the August 1944 Astounding, "The Wedge" in the October 1944 issue,
    and "Dead Hand" in the April 1945 issue. (These stories were written while I was working at the Navy
    Yard in Philadelphia.)

    On January 26, 1945, 1 began "The Mule," my personal favorite among the Foundation stories, and the
    longest yet, for it was 50,000 words. It was printed as a two-part serial (the very first serial I was ever
    responsible for) in the November and December 1945 issues. By the time the second part appeared I was
    in the army.

    After I got out of the army, I wrote "Now You See It-" which appeared in the January 1948 issue. By this
    time, though, I had grown tired of the Foundation stories so I tried to end them by setting up, and solving,
    the mystery of the location of the Second Foundation. Campbell would have none of that, however. He
    forced me to change the ending, and made me promise I would do one more Foundation story.

    Well, Campbell was the kind of editor who could not be denied, so I wrote one more Foundation story,
    vowing to myself that it would be the last. I called it "-And Now You Don't," and it appeared as a
    three-part serial in the November 1949, December 1949, and January 1950 issues of Astounding.

    By then, I was on the biochemistry faculty of Boston University School of Medicine, my first book had
    just been published, and I was determined to move on to new things. I had spent eight years on the
    Foundation, written nine stories with a total of about 220,000 words. My total earnings for the series
    came to $3,641 and that seemed enough. The Foundation was over and done with, as far as I was



    concerned.


    In 1950, however, hardcover science fiction was just coming into existence. I had no objection to earning
    a little more money by having the Foundation series reprinted in book form. I offered the series to
    Doubleday (which had already published a science-fiction novel by me, and which had contracted for
    another) and to Little-Brown, but both rejected it. In that year, though, a small publishing firm, Gnome
    Press, was beginning to be active, and it was prepared to do the Foundation series as three books.

    The publisher of Gnome felt, however, that the series began too abruptly. He persuaded me to write a
    small Foundation story, one that would serve as an introductory section to the first book (so that the first
    part of the Foundation series was the last written).

    In 1951, the Gnome Press edition of Foundation was published, containing the introduction and the first
    four stories of the series. In 1952, Foundation and Empire appeared, with the fifth and sixth stories; and
    in 1953, Second Foundation appeared, with the seventh and eighth stories. The three books together
    came to be called The Foundation Trilogy.

    The mere fact of the existence of the Trilogy pleased me, but Gnome Press did not have the financial
    clout or the publishing knowhow to get the books distributed properly, so that few copies were sold and
    fewer still paid me royalties. (Nowadays, copies of first editions of those Gnome Press books sell at $50
    a copy and up-but I still get no royalties from them.)

    Ace Books did put out paperback editions of Foundation and of Foundation and Empire, but they
    changed the titles, and used cut versions. Any money that was involved was paid to Gnome Press and I
    didn't see much of that. In the first decade of the existence of The Foundation Trilogy it may have earned
    something like $1500 total.

    And yet there was some foreign interest. In early 1961, Timothy Seldes, who was then my editor at
    Doubleday, told me that Doubleday had received a request for the Portuguese rights for the Foundation
    series and, since they weren't Doubleday books, he was passing them on to me. I sighed and said, "The
    heck with it, Tim. I don't get royalties on those books."

    Seldes was horrified, and instantly set about getting the books away from Gnome Press so that
    Doubleday could publish them instead. He paid no attention to my loudly expressed fears that Doubleday
    "would lose its shirt on them." In August 1961 an agreement was reached and the Foundation books
    became Doubleday property. What’s more, Avon Books, which had published a paperback version of
    Second Foundation, set about obtaining the rights to all three from Doubleday, and put out nice editions.

    From that moment on, the Foundation books took off and began to earn increasing royalties. They have
    sold well and steadily, both in hardcover and softcover, for two decades so far. Increasingly, the letters I
    received from the readers spoke of them in high praise. They received more attention than all my other
    books put together.

    Doubleday also published an omnibus volume, The Foundation Trilogy, for its Science Fiction Book
    Club. That omnibus volume has been continuously featured by the Book Club for over twenty years.

    Matters reached a climax in 1966. The fans organizing the World Science Fiction Convention for that
    year (to be held in Cleveland) decided to award a Hugo for the best all-time series, where the series, to
    qualify, had to consist of at least three connected novels. It was the first time such a category had been



    set up, nor has it been repeated since. The Foundation series was nominated, and I felt that was going to
    have to be glory enough for me, since I was sure that Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" would win.

    It didn't. The Foundation series won, and the Hugo I received for it has been sitting on my bookcase in
    the livingroom ever since.

    In among all this litany of success, both in money and in fame, there was one annoying side-effect.
    Readers couldn't help but notice that the books of the Foundation series covered only three hundred-plus
    years of the thousand-year hiatus between Empires. That meant the Foundation series "wasn't finished." I
    got innumerable letters from readers who asked me to finish it, from others who demanded I finish it, and
    still others who threatened dire vengeance if I didn't finish it. Worse yet, various editors at Doubleday
    over the years have pointed out that it might be wise to finish it.

    It was flattering, of course, but irritating as well. Years had passed, then decades. Back in the 1940s, I
    had been in a Foundation- writing mood. Now I wasn't. Starting in the late 1950s, I had been in a more
    and more nonfiction-writing mood.

    That didn't mean I was writing no fiction at all. In the 1960s and 1970s, in fact, I wrote two
    science-fiction novels and a mystery novel, to say nothing of well over a hundred short stories - but
    about eighty percent of what I wrote was nonfiction.

    One of the most indefatigable nags in the matter of finishing the Foundation series was my good friend,
    the great science-fiction writer, Lester del Rey. He was constantly telling me I ought to finish the series
    and was just as constantly suggesting plot devices. He even told Larry Ashmead, then my editor at
    Doubleday, that if I refused to write more Foundation stories, he, Lester, would be willing to take on the
    task.

    When Ashmead mentioned this to me in 1973, 1 began another Foundation novel out of sheer
    desperation. I called it "Lightning Rod" and managed to write fourteen pages before other tasks called me
    away. The fourteen pages were put away and additional years passed.

    In January 1977, Cathleen Jordan, then my editor at Doubleday, suggested I do "an important book - a
    Foundation novel, perhaps." I said, "I'd rather do an autobiography," and I did - 640,000 words of it.

    In January 1981, Doubleday apparently lost its temper. At least, Hugh O'Neill, then my editor there, said,
    "Betty Prashker wants to see you," and marched me into her office. She was then one of the senior
    editors, and a sweet and gentle person.

    She wasted no time. "Isaac," she said, "you are going to write a novel for us and you are going to sign a
    contract to that effect."

    "Betty," I said, "I am already working on a big science book for Doubleday and I have to revise the
    Biographical Encyclopedia for Doubleday and

    "It can all wait," she said. "You are going to sign a contract to do a novel. What's more, we're going to
    give you a $50,000 advance."

    That was a stunner. I don't like large advances. They put me under too great an obligation. My average
    advance is something like $3,000. Why not? It's all out of royalties.



    I said, "That's way too much money, Betty."

    "No, it isn't," she said.

    "Doubleday will lose its shirt," I said.

    "You keep telling us that all the time. It won't."

    I said, desperately, "All right. Have the contract read that I don't get any money until I notify you in
    writing that I have begun the novel."

    "Are you crazy?" she said. "You'll never start if that clause is in the contract. You get $25,000 on signing
    the contract, and $25,000 on delivering a completed manuscript."

    "But suppose the novel is no good."

    "Now you're being silly," she said, and she ended the conversation.

    That night, Pat LoBrutto, the science-fiction editor at Doubleday called to express his pleasure. "And
    remember," he said, "that when we say 'novel' we mean ’science-fiction novel,’ not anything else. And
    when we say ’science-fiction novel,’ we mean 'Foundation novel' and not anything else."

    On February 5, 1981, 1 signed the contract, and within the week, the Doubleday accounting system
    cranked out the check for $25,000.

    I moaned that I was not my own master anymore and Hugh O'Neill said, cheerfully, "That’s right, and
    from now on, we're going to call every other week and say, ’Where’s the manuscript?’" (But they didn't.
    They left me strictly alone, and never even asked for a progress report.)

    Nearly four months passed while I took care of a vast number of things I had to do, but about the end of
    May, I picked up my own copy of The Foundation Trilogy and began reading.

    I had to. For one thing, I hadn't read the Trilogy in thirty years and while I remembered the general plot, I
    did not remember the details. Besides, before beginning a new Foundation novel I had to immerse myself
    in the style and atmosphere of the series.

    I read it with mounting uneasiness. I kept waiting for something to happen, and nothing ever did. All
    three volumes, all the nearly quarter of a million words, consisted of thoughts and of conversations. No
    action. No physical suspense.

    What was all the fuss about, then? Why did everyone want more of that stuff? - To be sure, I couldn't
    help but notice that I was turning the pages eagerly, and that I was upset when I finished the book, and
    that I wanted more, but I was the author, for goodness' sake. You couldn't go by me.

    I was on the edge of deciding it was all a terrible mistake and of insisting on giving back the money,
    when (quite by accident, I swear) I came across some sentences by science-fiction writer and critic,

    James Gunn, who, in connection with the Foundation series, said, "Action and romance have little to do
    with the success of the Trilogy - virtually all the action takes place offstage, and the romance is almost
    invisible - but the stories provide a detective- story fascination with the permutations and reversals of
    ideas."

    Oh, well, if what was needed were "permutations and reversals of ideas," then that I could supply. Panic



    receded, and on June 10, 1981, 1 dug out the fourteen pages I had written more than eight years before
    and reread them. They sounded good to me. I didn't remember where I had been headed back then, but I
    had worked out what seemed to me to be a good ending now, and, starting page 15 on that day, I
    proceeded to work toward the new ending.

    I found, to my infinite relief, that I had no trouble getting back into a "Foundation-mood," and, fresh
    from my rereading, I had Foundation history at my finger-tips.

    There were differences, to be sure:

    1) The original stories were written for a science-fiction magazine and were from 7,000 to 50,000 words
    long, and no more. Consequently, each book in the trilogy had at least two stories and lacked unity. I
    intended to make the new book a single story.

    2) I had a particularly good chance for development since Hugh said, "Let the book find its own length,
    Isaac. We don't mind a long book." So I planned on 140,000 words, which was nearly three times the
    length of "The Mule," and this gave me plenty of elbow-room, and I could add all sorts of little touches.

    3) The Foundation series had been written at a time when our knowledge of astronomy was primitive
    compared with what it is today. I could take advantage of that and at least mention black holes, for
    instance. I could also take advantage of electronic computers, which had not been invented until I was
    half through with the series.

    The novel progressed steadily, and on January 17, 1982, 1 began final copy. I brought the manuscript to
    Hugh O'Neill in batches, and the poor fellow went half-crazy since he insisted on reading it in this
    broken fashion. On March 25, 1982, 1 brought in the last bit, and the very next day got the second half of
    the advance.

    I had kept "Lightning Rod" as my working title all the way through, but Hugh finally said, "Is there any
    way of putting 'Foundation' into the title, Isaac?" I suggested Foundations at Bay, therefore, and that may
    be the title that will actually be used. *

    You will have noticed that I have said nothing about the plot of the new Foundation novel. Well,
    naturally. I would rather you buy and read the book.

    And yet there is one thing I have to confess to you. I generally manage to tie up all the loose ends into
    one neat little bow-knot at the end of my stories, no matter how complicated the plot might be. In this
    case, however, I noticed that when I was all done, one glaring little item remained unresolved.

    I am hoping no one else notices it because it clearly points the way to the continuation of the series.

    It is even possible that I inadvertently gave this away for at the end of the novel, I wrote: "The End (for
    now)."

    I very much fear that if the novel proves successful, Doubleday will be at my throat again, as Campbell
    used to be in the old days. And yet what can I do but hope that the novel is very successful indeed. What
    a quandary !

    *Editor's note: The novel was published in October 1982 as Foundation's Edge.



    ABOUT THE AUTHOR


    Isaac Asimov was born in the Soviet Union to his great surprise. He moved quickly to correct the
    situation. When his parents emigrated to the United States, Isaac (three years old at the time) stowed
    away in their baggage. He has been an American citizen since the age of eight.

    Brought up in Brooklyn, and educated in its public schools, he eventually found his way to Columbia
    University and, over the protests of the school administration, managed to annex a series of degrees in
    chemistry, up to and including a Ph.D. He then infiltrated Boston University and climbed the academic
    ladder, ignoring all cries of outrage, until he found himself Professor of Biochemistry.

    Meanwhile, at the age of nine, he found the love of his life (in the inanimate sense) when he discovered
    his first science-fiction magazine. By the time he was eleven, he began to write stories, and at eighteen,
    he actually worked up the nerve to submit one. It was rejected. After four long months of tribulation and
    suffering, he sold his first story and, thereafter, he never looked back.

    In 1941, when he was twenty-one years old, he wrote the classic short story "Nightfall" and his future
    was assured. Shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories, and shortly after that he had
    begun his Foundation series.

    What was left except quantity? At the present time, he has published over 260 books, distributed through
    every major division of the Dewey system of library classification, and shows no signs of slowing up. He
    remains as youthful, as lively, and as lovable as ever, and grows more handsome with each year. You can
    be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity
    is notorious.

    He is married to Janet Jeppson, psychiatrist and writer, has two children by a previous marriage, and
    lives in New York City.

    THE STORY BEHIND THE "FOUNDATION"

    By ISAAC ASIMOV


    The date was August 1 , 1941 . World War II had been raging for two years. France had fallen,
    the Battle of Britain had been fought, and the Soviet Union had just been invaded by Nazi
    Germany. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was four months in the future.

    But on that day, with Europe in flames, and the evil shadow of Adolf Hitler apparently falling
    over all the world, what was chiefly on my mind was a meeting toward which I was hastening.

    I was 21 years old, a graduate student in chemistry at Columbia University, and I had been
    writing science fiction professionally for three years. In that time, I had sold five stories to John
    Campbell, editor of Astounding, and the fifth story, "Nightfall," was about to appear in the
    September 1941 issue of the magazine. I had an appointment to see Mr. Campbell to tell him
    the plot of a new story I was planning to write, and the catch was that I had no plot in mind, not
    the trace of one.

    I therefore tried a device I sometimes use. I opened a book at random and set up free
    association, beginning with whatever I first saw. The book I had with me was a collection of the
    Gilbert and Sullivan plays. I happened to open it to the picture of the Fairy Queen of lolanthe
    throwing herself at the feet of Private Willis. I thought of soldiers, of military empires, of the
    Roman Empire - of a Galactic Empire - aha!


    Why shouldn't I write of the fall of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism, written
    from the viewpoint of someone in the secure days of the Second Galactic Empire? After all, I
    had read Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire not once, but twice.

    I was bubbling over by the time I got to Campbell's, and my enthusiasm must have been
    catching for Campbell blazed up as I had never seen him do. In the course of an hour we built
    up the notion of a vast series of connected stories that were to deal in intricate detail with the
    thousand-year period between the First and Second Galactic Empires. This was to be
    illuminated by the science of psychohistory, which Campbell and I thrashed out between us.

    On August 11,1 941 , therefore, I began the story of that interregnum and called it "Foundation."
    In it, I described how the psychohistorian, Hari Seldon, established a pair of Foundations at
    opposite ends of the Universe under such circumstances as to make sure that the forces of
    history would bring about the second Empire after one thousand years instead of the thirty
    thousand that would be required otherwise.

    The story was submitted on September 8 and, to make sure that Campbell really meant what
    he said about a series, I ended "Foundation" on a cliff-hanger. Thus, it seemed to me, he would
    be forced to buy a second story.

    Flowever, when I started the second story (on October 24), I found that I had outsmarted
    myself. I quickly wrote myself into an impasse, and the Foundation series would have died an
    ignominious death had I not had a conversation with Fred Pohl on November 2 (on the
    Brooklyn Bridge, as it happened). I don't remember what Fred actually said, but, whatever it
    was, it pulled me out of the hole.

    "Foundation" appeared in the May 1942 issue of Astounding and the succeeding story, "Bridle
    and Saddle," in the June 1942 issue.

    After that there was only the routine trouble of writing the stories. Through the remainder of the
    decade, John Campbell kept my nose to the grindstone and made sure he got additional
    Foundation stories.

    "The Big and the Little" was in the August 1944 Astounding, "The Wedge" in the October 1944
    issue, and "Dead Fland" in the April 1945 issue. (These stories were written while I was working
    at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia.)

    On January 26, 1945, I began "The Mule," my personal favorite among the Foundation stories,
    and the longest yet, for it was 50,000 words. It was printed as a two-part serial (the very first
    serial I was ever responsible for) in the November and December 1945 issues. By the time the
    second part appeared I was in the army.

    After I got out of the army, I wrote "Now You See It-" which appeared in the January 1948
    issue. By this time, though, I had grown tired of the Foundation stories so I tried to end them by
    setting up, and solving, the mystery of the location of the Second Foundation. Campbell would
    have none of that, however. Fie forced me to change the ending, and made me promise I would
    do one more Foundation story.

    Well, Campbell was the kind of editor who could not be denied, so I wrote one more Foundation



    story, vowing to myself that it would be the last. I called it "-And Now You Don't," and it
    appeared as a three-part serial in the November 1949, December 1949, and January 1950
    issues of Astounding.

    By then, I was on the biochemistry faculty of Boston University School of Medicine, my first
    book had just been published, and I was determined to move on to new things. I had spent
    eight years on the Foundation, written nine stories with a total of about 220,000 words. My total
    earnings for the series came to $3,641 and that seemed enough. The Foundation was over and
    done with, as far as I was concerned.

    In 1950, however, hardcover science fiction was just coming into existence. I had no objection
    to earning a little more money by having the Foundation series reprinted in book form. I offered
    the series to Doubleday (which had already published a science-fiction novel by me, and which
    had contracted for another) and to Little-Brown, but both rejected it. In that year, though, a
    small publishing firm, Gnome Press, was beginning to be active, and it was prepared to do the
    Foundation series as three books.

    The publisher of Gnome felt, however, that the series began too abruptly. Fie persuaded me to
    write a small Foundation story, one that would serve as an introductory section to the first book
    (so that the first part of the Foundation series was the last written).

    In 1951 , the Gnome Press edition of Foundation was published, containing the introduction and
    the first four stories of the series. In 1 952, Foundation and Empire appeared, with the fifth and
    sixth stories; and in 1953, Second Foundation appeared, with the seventh and eighth stories.
    The three books together came to be called The Foundation Trilogy.

    The mere fact of the existence of the Trilogy pleased me, but Gnome Press did not have the
    financial clout or the publishing knowhow to get the books distributed properly, so that few
    copies were sold and fewer still paid me royalties. (Nowadays, copies of first editions of those

    Ace Books did put out paperback editions of Foundation and of Foundation and Empire, but
    they changed the titles, and used cut versions. Any money that was involved was paid to
    Gnome Press and I didn't see much of that. In the first decade of the existence of The

    for the Foundation series and, since they weren't Doubleday books, he was passing them on to
    me. I sighed and said, "The heck with it, Tim. I don't get royalties on those books."

    Seldes was horrified, and instantly set about getting the books away from Gnome Press so that
    Doubleday could publish them instead. Fie paid no attention to my loudly expressed fears that
    Doubleday "would lose its shirt on them." In August 1961 an agreement was reached and the

    published a paperback version of Second Foundation, set about obtaining the rights to all three
    from Doubleday, and put out nice editions.

    From that moment on, the Foundation books took off and began to earn increasing royalties.



    They have sold well and steadily, both in hardcover and softcover, for two decades so far.
    Increasingly, the letters I received from the readers spoke of them in high praise. They received
    more attention than all my other books put together.

    Doubleday also published an omnibus volume, The Foundation Trilogy, for its Science Fiction
    Book Club. That omnibus volume has been continuously featured by the Book Club for over
    twenty years.

    Matters reached a climax in 1966. The fans organizing the World Science Fiction Convention
    for that year (to be held in Cleveland) decided to award a Flugo for the best all-time series,
    where the series, to qualify, had to consist of at least three connected novels. It was the first
    time such a category had been set up, nor has it been repeated since. The Foundation series
    was nominated, and I felt that was going to have to be glory enough for me, since I was sure
    that Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" would win.

    It didn't. The Foundation series won, and the Hugo I received for it has been sitting on my
    bookcase in the livingroom ever since.

    In among all this litany of success, both in money and in fame, there was one annoying
    side-effect. Readers couldn't help but notice that the books of the Foundation series covered
    only three hundred-plus years of the thousand-year hiatus between Empires. That meant the
    Foundation series "wasn't finished." I got innumerable letters from readers who asked me to
    finish it, from others who demanded I finish it, and still others who threatened dire vengeance if
    I didn't finish it. Worse yet, various editors at Doubleday over the years have pointed out that it

    It was flattering, of course, but irritating as well. Years had passed, then decades. Back in the
    1940s, I had been in a Foundation-writing mood. Now I wasn't. Starting in the late 1950s, I had
    been in a more and more nonfiction-writing mood.

    That didn't mean I was writing no fiction at all. In the 1960s and 1970s, in fact, I wrote two
    science-fiction novels and a mystery novel, to say nothing of well over a hundred short stories -

    Ashmead, then my editor at Doubleday, that if I refused to write more Foundation stories, he,
    Lester, would be willing to take on the task.

    When Ashmead mentioned this to me in 1973, I began another Foundation novel out of sheer
    desperation. I called it "Lightning Rod" and managed to write fourteen pages before other tasks
    called me away. The fourteen pages were put away and additional years passed.

    In January 1977, Cathleen Jordan, then my editor at Doubleday, suggested I do "an important
    book - a Foundation novel, perhaps." I said, "I'd rather do an autobiography," and I did-
    640,000 words of it.


    In January 1981, Doubleday apparently lost its temper. At least, Hugh O'Neill, then my editor



    there, said, "Betty Prashker wants to see you," and marched me into her office. She was then
    one of the senior editors, and a sweet and gentle person.

    She wasted no time. "Isaac," she said, "you are going to write a novel for us and you are going
    to sign a contract to that effect."

    "Betty," I said, "I am already working on a big science book for Doubleday and I have to revise
    the Biographical Encyclopedia for Doubleday and

    "It can all wait," she said. "You are going to sign a contract to do a novel. What's more, we're
    going to give you a $50,000 advance."

    That was a stunner. I don't like large advances. They put me under too great an obligation. My
    average advance is something like $3,000. Why not? It's all out of royalties.

    I said, "That's way too much money, Betty."

    "No, it isn't," she said.

    "Doubleday will lose its shirt," I said.

    "You keep telling us that all the time. It won't."

    I said, desperately, "All right. Have the contract read that I don't get any money until I notify you
    in writing that I have begun the novel."

    "Are you crazy?" she said. "You'll never start if that clause is in the contract. You get $25,000
    on signing the contract, and $25,000 on delivering a completed manuscript."

    "But suppose the novel is no good."

    "Now you're being silly," she said, and she ended the conversation.

    That night, Pat LoBrutto, the science-fiction editor at Doubleday called to express his pleasure.
    "And remember," he said, "that when we say 'novel' we mean 'science-fiction novel,' not
    anything else. And when we say 'science-fiction novel,' we mean 'Foundation novel' and not
    anything else."

    On February 5, 1981 , I signed the contract, and within the week, the Doubleday accounting
    system cranked out the check for $25,000.

    I moaned that I was not my own master anymore and Hugh O'Neill said, cheerfully, "That's
    right, and from now on, we're going to call every other week and say, 'Where's the
    manuscript?’" (But they didn't. They left me strictly alone, and never even asked for a progress
    report.)

    Nearly four months passed while I took care of a vast number of things I had to do, but about
    the end of May, I picked up my own copy of The Foundation Trilogy and began reading.

    I had to. For one thing, I hadn't read the Trilogy in thirty years and while I remembered the
    general plot, I did not remember the details. Besides, before beginning a new Foundation novel
    I had to immerse myself in the style and atmosphere of the series.



    I read it with mounting uneasiness. I kept waiting for something to happen, and nothing ever
    did. All three volumes, all the nearly quarter of a million words, consisted of thoughts and of
    conversations. No action. No physical suspense.

    What was all the fuss about, then? Why did everyone want more of that stuff? - To be sure, I
    couldn't help but notice that I was turning the pages eagerly, and that I was upset when I
    finished the book, and that I wanted more, but I was the author, for goodness' sake. You
    couldn't go by me.

    I was on the edge of deciding it was all a terrible mistake and of insisting on giving back the
    money, when (quite by accident, I swear) I came across some sentences by science-fiction
    writer and critic, James Gunn, who, in connection with the Foundation series, said, "Action and
    romance have little to do with the success of the Trilogy- virtually all the action takes place
    offstage, and the romance is almost invisible - but the stories provide a detective-story
    fascination with the permutations and reversals of ideas."

    Oh, well, if what was needed were "permutations and reversals of ideas," then that I could
    supply. Panic receded, and on June 10, 1981, I dug out the fourteen pages I had written more
    than eight years before and reread them. They sounded good to me. I didn't remember where I
    had been headed back then, but I had worked out what seemed to me to be a good ending
    now, and, starting page 15 on that day, I proceeded to work toward the new ending.

    I found, to my infinite relief, that I had no trouble getting back into a "Foundation-mood," and,
    fresh from my rereading, I had Foundation history at my finger-tips.

    There were differences, to be sure:

    1 ) The original stories were written for a science-fiction magazine and were from 7,000 to
    50,000 words long, and no more. Consequently, each book in the trilogy had at least two
    stories and lacked unity. I intended to make the new book a single story.

    2) I had a particularly good chance for development since Flugh said, "Let the book find its own
    length, Isaac. We don't mind a long book." So I planned on 140,000 words, which was nearly
    three times the length of "The Mule," and this gave me plenty of elbow-room, and I could add
    all sorts of little touches.

    3) The Foundation series had been written at a time when our knowledge of astronomy was
    primitive compared with what it is today. I could take advantage of that and at least mention
    black holes, for instance. I could also take advantage of electronic computers, which had not
    been invented until I was half through with the series.

    The novel progressed steadily, and on January 17, 1982, I began final copy. I brought the
    manuscript to Hugh O'Neill in batches, and the poor fellow went half-crazy since he insisted on
    reading it in this broken fashion. On March 25, 1982, I brought in the last bit, and the very next
    day got the second half of the advance.

    I had kept "Lightning Rod" as my working title all the way through, but Hugh finally said, "Is
    there any way of putting 'Foundation' into the title, Isaac?" I suggested Foundations at Bay,
    therefore, and that may be the title that will actually be used. *



    You will have noticed that I have said nothing about the plot of the new Foundation novel. Well,
    naturally. I would rather you buy and read the book.

    And yet there is one thing I have to confess to you. I generally manage to tie up all the loose
    ends into one neat little bow-knot at the end of my stories, no matter how complicated the plot
    might be. In this case, however, I noticed that when I was all done, one glaring little item
    remained unresolved.

    I am hoping no one else notices it because it clearly points the way to the continuation of the
    series.

    It is even possible that I inadvertently gave this away for at the end of the novel, I wrote: "The
    End (for now)."

    I very much fear that if the novel proves successful, Doubleday will be at my throat again, as
    Campbell used to be in the old days. And yet what can I do but hope that the novel is very
    successful indeed. What a quandary!

    *Editor's note: The novel was published in October 1982 as Foundation's Edge.

    THE PSYCHOHISTORIANS

    i.

    HARI SELDON-... bom In the 1 1,988th year of the Galactic Era; died 12,069. The dates are
    more commonly given In terms of the current Foundational Era as - 79 to the year 1 F.E. Born
    to middle-class parents on Flelicon, Arcturus sector (where his father, In a legend of doubtful
    authenticity, was a tobacco grower in the hydroponic plants of the planet), he early showed
    amazing ability in mathematics. Anecdotes concerning his ability are innumerable, and some
    are contradictory. At the age of two, he is said to have ...

    ... Undoubtedly his greatest contributions were in the field of psychohistory. Seldon found the
    field little more than a set of vague axioms; he left it a profound statistical science....

    ... The best existing authority we have for the details of his life is the biography written by Gaal
    Dornick who. as a young man, met Seldon two years before the great mathematician's death.
    The story of the meeting ...

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA*

    * All quotations from the Encyclopedia Galactica here reproduced are taken from the 1 1 6th
    Edition published in 1020 F.E. by the Encyclopedia Galactica Publishing Co., Terminus, with
    permission of the publishers.




    His name was Gaal Dornick and he was just a country boy who had never seen Trantor before.
    That is, not in real life. He had seen it many times on the hyper-video, and occasionally in
    tremendous three-dimensional newscasts covering an Imperial Coronation or the opening of a
    Galactic Council. Even though he had lived all his life on the world of Synnax, which circled a
    star at the edges of the Blue Drift, he was not cut off from civilization, you see. At that time, no
    place in the Galaxy was.

    There were nearly twenty-five million inhabited planets in the Galaxy then, and not one but
    owed allegiance to the Empire whose seat was on Trantor. It was the last halfcentury in which
    that could be said.

    To Gaal, this trip was the undoubted climax of his young, scholarly life. He had been in space
    before so that the trip, as a voyage and nothing more, meant little to him. To be sure, he had
    traveled previously only as far as Synnax's only satellite in order to get the data on the
    mechanics of meteor driftage which he needed for his dissertation, but space-travel was all one
    whether one travelled half a million miles, or as many light years.

    He had steeled himself just a little for the Jump through hyper-space, a phenomenon one did
    not experience in simple interplanetary trips. The Jump remained, and would probably remain
    forever, the only practical method of travelling between the stars. Travel through ordinary space
    could proceed at no rate more rapid than that of ordinary light (a bit of scientific knowledge that
    belonged among the items known since the forgotten dawn of human history), and that would
    have meant years of travel between even the nearest of inhabited systems. Through
    hyper-space, that unimaginable region that was neither space nor time, matter nor energy,
    something nor nothing, one could traverse the length of the Galaxy in the interval between two
    neighboring instants of time.

    Gaal had waited for the first of those Jumps with a little dread curled gently in his stomach, and
    it ended in nothing more than a trifling jar, a little internal kick which ceased an instant before
    he could be sure he had felt it. That was all.

    And after that, there was only the ship, large and glistening; the cool production of 12,000 years
    of Imperial progress; and himself, with his doctorate in mathematics freshly obtained and an
    invitation from the great Hari Seldon to come to Trantor and join the vast and somewhat
    mysterious Seldon Project.

    What Gaal was waiting for after the disappointment of the Jump was that first sight of Trantor.
    He haunted the View-room. The steel shutter-lids were rolled back at announced times and he
    was always there, watching the hard brilliance of the stars, enjoying the incredible hazy swarm
    of a star cluster, like a giant conglomeration of fire-flies caught in mid-motion and stilled forever,
    At one time there was the cold, blue-white smoke of a gaseous nebula within five light years of
    the ship, spreading over the window like distant milk, filling the room with an icy tinge, and
    disappearing out of sight two hours later, after another Jump.

    The first sight of Trantor's sun was that of a hard, white speck all but lost in a myriad such, and
    recognizable only because it was pointed out by the ship's guide. The stars were thick here
    near the Galactic center. But with each Jump, it shone more brightly, drowning out the rest,
    paling them and thinning them out.



    An officer came through and said, "View-room will be closed for the remainder of the trip.
    Prepare for landing."

    Gaal had followed after, clutching at the sleeve of the white uniform with the
    Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire on it.

    He said, "Would it be possible to let me stay? I would like to see Trantor."

    The officer smiled and Gaal flushed a bit. It occurred to him that he spoke with a provincial
    accent.

    The officer said, "We'll be landing on Trantor by morning."

    "I mean I want to see it from Space."

    "Oh. Sorry, my boy. If this were a space-yacht we might manage it. But we're spinning down,
    sunside. You wouldn't want to be blinded, burnt, and radiation-scarred all at the same time,
    would you?"

    Gaal started to walk away.

    The officer called after him, "Trantor would only be gray blur anyway, Kid. Why don't you take a
    space-tour once you hit Trantor. They're cheap."

    Gaal looked back, "Thank you very much."

    It was childish to feel disappointed, but childishness comes almost as naturally to a man as to a
    child, and there was a lump in Gaal's throat. He had never seen Trantor spread out in all its
    incredibility, as large as life, and he hadn't expected to have to wait longer.


    2 .

    The ship landed in a medley of noises. There was the far-off hiss of the atmosphere cutting and
    sliding past the metal of the ship. There was the steady drone of the conditioners fighting the
    heat of friction, and the slower rumble of the engines enforcing deceleration. There was the
    human sound of men and women gathering in the debarkation rooms and the grind of the
    hoists lifting baggage, mail, and freight to the long axis of the ship, from which they would be
    later moved along to the unloading platform.

    Gaal felt the slight jar that indicated the ship no longer had an independent motion of its own.
    Ship's gravity had been giving way to planetary gravity for hours. Thousands of passengers had
    been sitting patiently in the debarkation rooms which swung easily on yielding force-fields to
    accommodate its orientation to the changing direction of the gravitational forces. Now they
    were crawling down curving ramps to the large, yawning locks.

    Gaal's baggage was minor. He stood at a desk, as it was quickly and expertly taken apart and
    put together again. His visa was inspected and stamped. He himself paid no attention.

    This was Trantor! The air seemed a little thicker here, the gravity a bit greater, than on his



    home planet of Synnax, but he would get used to that. He wondered if he would get used to
    immensity.

    Debarkation Building was tremendous. The roof was almost lost in the heights. Gaal could
    almost imagine that clouds could form beneath its immensity. He could see no opposite wall;
    just men and desks and converging floor till it faded out in haze.

    The man at the desk was speaking again. He sounded annoyed. He said, "Move on, Dornick."
    He had to open the visa, look again, before he remembered the name.

    Gaal said, "Where- where-"

    The man at the desk jerked a thumb, "Taxis to the right and third left."

    Gaal moved, seeing the glowing twists of air suspended high in nothingness and reading,
    "TAXIS TO ALL POINTS."

    A figure detached itself from anonymity and stopped at the desk, as Gaal left. The man at the
    desk looked up and nodded briefly. The figure nodded in return and followed the young
    immigrant.

    He was in time to hear Gaal's destination.

    Gaal found himself hard against a railing.

    The small siqn said, "Supervisor." The man to whom the siqn referred did not look up. He said,
    "Where to?"

    Gaal wasn't sure, but even a few seconds hesitation meant men queuing in line behind him.
    The Supervisor looked up, "Where to?"

    Gaal's funds were low, but there was only this one night and then he would have a job. He tried
    to sound nonchalant, "A good hotel, please."

    The Supervisor was unimpressed, "They're all good. Name one."

    Gaal said, desperately, "The nearest one, please."

    The Supervisor touched a button. A thin line of light formed along the floor, twisting among
    others which brightened and dimmed in different colors and shades. A ticket was shoved into
    Gaal's hands. It glowed faintly.

    The Supervisor said, "One point twelve."

    Gaal fumbled for the coins. He said, "Where do I go?"

    "Follow the light. The ticket will keep glowing as long as you're pointed in the tight direction."

    Gaal looked up and began walking. There were hundreds creeping across the vast floor,
    following their individual trails, sifting and straining themselves through intersection points to
    arrive at their respective destinations.



    His own trail ended. A man in glaring blue and yellow uniform, shining and new in unstainable
    plasto-textile, reached for his two bags.

    "Direct line to the Luxor," he said.

    The man who followed Gaal heard that. He also heard Gaal say, "Fine," and watched him enter
    the blunt-nosed vehicle.

    The taxi lifted straight up. Gaal stared out the curved, transparent window, marvelling at the
    sensation of airflight within an enclosed structure and clutching instinctively at the back of the
    driver's seat. The vastness contracted and the people became ants in random distribution. The
    scene contracted further and began to slide backward.

    There was a wall ahead. It began high in the air and extended upward out of sight. It was
    riddled with holes that were the mouths of tunnels. Gaal's taxi moved toward one then plunged
    into it. For a moment, Gaal wondered idly how his driver could pick out one among so many.

    There was now only blackness, with nothing but the past-flashing of a colored signal light to
    relieve the gloom. The air was full of a rushing sound.

    Gaal leaned forward against deceleration then and the taxi popped out of the tunnel and
    descended to ground-level once more.

    "The Luxor Hotel," said the driver, unnecessarily. He helped Gaal with his baggage, accepted a
    tenth-credit tip with a businesslike air, picked up a waiting passenger, and was rising again.

    In all this, from the moment of debarkation, there had been no glimpse of sky.


    3 .

    TRANTOR-...At the beginning of the thirteenth millennium, this tendency reached its climax. As
    the center of the imperial Government for unbroken hundreds of generations and located, as it
    was, toward the central regions of the Galaxy among the most densely populated and
    industrially advanced worlds of the system, it could scarcely help being the densest and richest
    clot of humanity the Race had ever seen.

    Its urbanization, progressing steadily, had finally reached the ultimate. All the land surface of
    Trantor, 75,000,000 square miles in extent, was a single city. The population, at its height, was
    well in excess of forty billions. This enormous population was devoted almost entirely to the
    administrative necessities of Empire, and found themselves all too few for the complications of
    the task. (It is to be remembered that the impossibility of proper administration of the Galactic
    Empire under the uninspired leadership of the later Emperors was a considerable factor in the
    Fall.) Daily, fleets of ships in the tens of thousands brought the produce of twenty agricultural
    worlds to the dinner tables of Trantor....

    Its dependence upon the outer worlds for food and, indeed, for all necessities of life, made
    Trantor increasingly vulnerable to conquest by siege. In the last millennium of the Empire, the
    monotonously numerous revolts made Emperor after Emperor conscious of this, and Imperial



    policy became little more than the protection of Trantor's delicate jugular vein....
    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Gaal was not certain whether the sun shone, or, for that matter, whether it was day or night. He
    was ashamed to ask. All the planet seemed to live beneath metal. The meal of which he had
    just partaken had been labelled luncheon, but there were many planets which lived a standard
    timescale that took no account of the perhaps inconvenient alternation of day and night. The
    rate of planetary turnings differed, and he did not know that of Trantor.

    At first, he had eagerly followed the signs to the "Sun Room" and found it but a chamber for
    basking in artificial radiation. He lingered a moment or two, then returned to the Luxor's main
    lobby.

    He said to the room clerk, "Where can I buy a ticket for a planetary tour?"

    "Right here."

    "When will it start?"

    "You just missed it. Another one tomorrow. Buy a ticket now and we'll reserve a place for you."

    "Oh." Tomorrow would be too late. He would have to be at the University tomorrow. He said,
    "There wouldn't be an observation tower - or something? I mean, in the open air."

    "Sure! Sell you a ticket for that, if you want. Better let me check if it's raining or not." He closed
    a contact at his elbow and read the flowing letters that raced across a frosted screen. Gaal read
    with him.

    The room clerk said, "Good weather. Come to think of it, I do believe it's the dry season now."
    He added, conversationally, "I don't bother with the outside myself. The last time I was in the
    open was three years ago. You see it once, you know and that's all there is to it. Here's your
    ticket. Special elevator in the rear. It's marked 'To the Tower.' Just take it."

    The elevator was of the new sort that ran by gravitic repulsion. Gaal entered and others flowed
    in behind him. The operator closed a contact. For a moment, Gaal felt suspended in space as
    gravity switched to zero, and then he had weight again in small measure as the elevator
    accelerated upward. Deceleration followed and his feet left the floor. He squawked against his
    will.

    The operator called out, "Tuck your feet under the railing. Can't you read the sign?"

    The others had done so. They were smiling at him as he madly and vainly tried to clamber back
    down the wall. Their shoes pressed upward against the chromium of the railings that stretched
    across the floor in parallels set two feet apart. He had noticed those railings on entering and
    had ignored them.

    Then a hand reached out and pulled him down.

    He gasped his thanks as the elevator came to a halt.

    He stepped out upon an open terrace bathed in a white brilliance that hurl his eyes. The man,



    whose helping hand he had just now been the recipient of, was immediately behind him.

    The man said, kindly, "Plenty of seats."

    Gaal closed his mouth; he had been gaping; and said, "It certainly seems so." He started for
    them automatically, then stopped.

    He said, "If you don't mind, I'll just stop a moment at the railing. I - I want to look a bit."

    The man waved him on, good-naturedly, and Gaal leaned out over the shoulder-high railing
    and bathed himself in all the panorama.

    He could not see the ground. It was lost in the ever increasing complexities of man-made
    structures. He could see no horizon other than that of metal against sky, stretching out to
    almost uniform grayness, and he knew it was so over all the land-surface of the planet. There
    was scarcely any motion to be seen - a few pleasure-craft lazed against the sky-but all the
    busy traffic of billions of men were going on, he knew, beneath the metal skin of the world.

    There was no green to be seen; no green, no soil, no life other than man. Somewhere on the
    world, he realized vaguely, was the Emperor's palace, set amid one hundred square miles of
    natural soil, green with trees, rainbowed with flowers. It was a small island amid an ocean of
    steel, but it wasn't visible from where he stood. It might be ten thousand miles away. He did not
    know.

    Before very long, he must have his tour!

    He sighed noisily, and realized finally that he was on Trantor at last; on the planet which was
    the center of all the Galaxy and the kernel of the human race. He saw none of its weaknesses.
    He saw no ships of food landing. He was not aware of a jugular vein delicately connecting the
    forty billion of Trantor with the rest of the Galaxy. He was conscious only of the mightiest deed
    of man; the complete and almost contemptuously final conquest of a world.

    He came away a little blank-eyed. His friend of the elevator was indicating a seat next to
    himself and Gaal took it.

    The man smiled. "My name is Jerril. First time on Trantor?"

    "Yes, Mr. Jerril."

    "Thought so. Jerril's my first name. Trantor gets you if you've got the poetic temperament.
    Trantorians never come up here, though. They don't like it. Gives them nerves."

    "Nerves! - My name's Gaal, by the way. Why should it give them nerves? It's glorious."

    "Subjective matter of opinion, Gaal. If you're born in a cubicle and grow up in a corridor, and
    work in a cell, and vacation in a crowded sun-room, then coming up into the open with nothing
    but sky over you might just give you a nervous breakdown. They make the children come up
    here once a year, after they're five. I don't know if it does any good. They don't get enough of it,
    really, and the first few times they scream themselves into hysteria. They ought to start as soon
    as they're weaned and have the trip once a week."



    He went on, "Of course, it doesn't really matter. What if they never come out at all? They're
    happy down there and they run the Empire. How high up do you think we are?"

    He said, "Half a mile?" and wondered if that sounded naive.

    It must have, for Jerril chuckled a little. He said, "No. Just five hundred feet."

    "What? But the elevator took about

    "I know. But most of the time it was just getting up to ground level. Trantor is tunneled over a
    mile down. It's like an iceberg. Nine-tenths of it is out of sight. It even works itself out a few
    miles into the sub-ocean soil at the shorelines. In fact, we're down so low that we can make use
    of the temperature difference between ground level and a couple of miles under to supply us
    with all the energy we need. Did you know that?"

    "No, I thought you used atomic generators."

    "Did once. But this is cheaper."

    "I imagine so."

    "What do you think of it all?" For a moment, the man's good nature evaporated into
    shrewdness. He looked almost sly.

    Gaal fumbled. "Glorious," he said, again.

    "Here on vacation? Traveling? Sight-seeing?"

    "No exactly. At least, I've always wanted to visit Trantor but I came here primarily for a job."
    "Oh?"

    Gaal felt obliged to explain further, "With Dr. Seldon's project at the University of Trantor."
    "Raven Seldon?"

    "Why, no. The one I mean is Hari Seldon. -The psychohistorian Seldon. I don't know of any
    Raven Seldon."

    "Hari's the one I mean. They call him Raven. Slang, you know. He keeps predicting disaster."
    "He does?" Gaal was genuinely astonished.

    "Surely, you must know." Jerril was not smiling. "You're coming to work for him, aren't you?"
    "Well, yes, I'm a mathematician. Why does he predict disaster? What kind of disaster?"

    "What kind would you think?"

    "I'm afraid I wouldn't have the least idea. I've read the papers Dr. Seldon and his group have
    published. They're on mathematical theory."

    "Yes, the ones they publish."



    Gaal felt annoyed. He said, "I think I'll go to my room now. Very pleased to have met you."

    Jerril waved his arm indifferently in farewell.

    Gaal found a man waiting for him in his room. For a moment, he was too startled to put into
    words the inevitable, "What are you doing here?" that came to his lips.

    The man rose. He was old and almost bald and he walked with a limp, but his eyes were very
    bright and blue.

    He said, "I am Hari Seldon," an instant before Gaal's befuddled brain placed the face alongside
    the memory of the many times he had seen it in pictures.


    4 .

    PSYCHOHISTORY-.. .Gaal Dornick, using nonmathematical concepts, has defined
    psychohistory to be that branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions of human
    conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli....

    ... Implicit in all these definitions is the assumption that the human conglomerate being dealt
    with is sufficiently large for valid statistical treatment. The necessary size of such a
    conglomerate may be determined by Seldon 's First Theorem which ...A further necessary
    assumption is that the human conglomerate be itself unaware of psychohistoric analysis in

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    "Good afternoon, sir," said Gaal. "I- I-"

    "You didn't think we were to meet before tomorrow? Ordinarily, we would not have. It is just that
    if we are to use your services, we must work quickly. It grows continually more difficult to obtain
    recruits."

    "I don't understand, sir."

    "You were talking to a man on the observation tower, were you not?"

    "Yes. His first name is Jerril. I know no more about him. "

    "His name is nothing. He is an agent of the Commission of Public Safety. He followed you from
    the space-port."

    "But why? I am afraid I am very confused."

    "Did the man on the tower say nothing about me?"

    Gaal hesitated, "He referred to you as Raven Seldon."



    "Did he say why?"

    "He said you predict disaster."

    "I do. What does Trantor mean to you?"

    Everyone seemed to be asking his opinion of Trantor. Gaal felt incapable of response beyond
    the bare word, "Glorious."

    "You say that without thinking. What of psychohistory?"

    "I haven't thought of applying it to the problem."

    "Before you are done with me, young man, you will learn to apply psychohistory to all problems
    as a matter of course. -Observe." Seldon removed his calculator pad from the pouch at his
    belt. Men said he kept one beneath his pillow for use in moments of wakefulness. Its gray,
    glossy finish was slightly worn by use. Seldon's nimble fingers, spotted now with age, played
    along the files and rows of buttons that filled its surface. Red symbols glowed out from the
    upper tier.

    He said, "That represents the condition of the Empire at present."

    He waited.

    Gaal said finally, "Surely that is not a complete representation."

    "No, not complete," said Seldon. "I am glad you do not accept my word blindly. However, this is
    an approximation which will serve to demonstrate the proposition. Will you accept that?"

    "Subject to my later verification of the derivation of the function, yes." Gaal was carefully
    avoiding a possible trap.

    "Good. Add to this the known probability of Imperial assassination, viceregal revolt, the
    contemporary recurrence of periods of economic depression, the declining rate of planetary
    explorations, the. . ."

    He proceeded. As each item was mentioned, new symbols sprang to life at his touch, and
    melted into the basic function which expanded and changed.

    Gaal stopped him only once. "I don't see the validity of that set-transformation."

    Seldon repeated it more slowly.

    Gaal said, "But that is done by way of a forbidden sociooperation."

    "Good. You are quick, but not yet quick enough. It is not forbidden in this connection. Let me do
    it by expansions."


    The procedure was much longer and at its end, Gaal said, humbly, "Yes, I see now."

    Finally, Seldon stopped. "This is Trantor three centuries from now. How do you interpret that?



    Eh?" He put his head to one side and waited.

    Gaal said, unbelievingly, "Total destruction! But - but that is impossible. Trantor has never
    been -"

    Seldon was filled with the intense excitement of a man whose body only had grown old. "Come,
    come. You saw how the result was arrived at. Put it into words. Forget the symbolism for a
    moment."

    Gaal said, "As Trantor becomes more specialized, it be comes more vulnerable, less able to
    defend itself. Further, as it becomes more and more the administrative center of Empire, it
    becomes a greater prize. As the Imperial succession becomes more and more uncertain, and
    the feuds among the great families more rampant, social responsibility disappears. "

    "Enough. And what of the numerical probability of total destruction within three centuries?"

    "I couldn't tell."

    "Surely you can perform a field-differentiation?"

    Gaal felt himself under pressure. He was not offered the calculator pad. It was held a foot from
    his eyes. He calculated furiously and felt his forehead grow slick with sweat.

    He said, "About 85%?"

    "Not bad," said Seldon, thrusting out a lower lip, "but not good. The actual figure is 92.5%."

    Gaal said, "And so you are called Raven Seldon? I have seen none of this in the journals."

    "But of course not. This is unprintable. Do you suppose the Imperium could expose its
    shakiness in this manner. That is a very simple demonstration in psychohistory. But some of
    our results have leaked out among the aristocracy."

    "That's bad."

    "Not necessarily. All is taken into account."

    "But is that why I'm being investigated?"

    "Yes. Everything about my project is being investigated."

    "Are you in danger, sir?"

    "Oh, yes. There is probability of 1 .7% that I will be executed, but of course that will not stop the
    project. We have taken that into account as well. Well, never mind. You will meet me, I
    suppose, at the University tomorrow?"

    "I will," said Gaal.


    5 .



    COMMISSION OF PUBLIC SAFETY-... The aristocratic coterie rose to power after the
    assassination of Cleon I, last of the Entuns. In the main, they formed an element of order during
    the centuries of instability and uncertainty in the Imperium. Usually under the control of the
    great families of the Chens and the Divarts, it degenerated eventually into a blind instrument for
    maintenance of the status quo.... They were not completely removed as a power in the state
    until after the accession of the last strong Emperor, Cleon H. The first Chief Commissioner....

    ... In a way, the beginning of the Commission's decline can be traced to the trial of Fiari Seldon
    two years before the beginning of the Foundational Era. That trial is described in Gaal Dornick's
    biography of Fiari Seldon....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Gaal did not carry out his promise. He was awakened the next morning by a muted buzzer. He
    answered it, and the voice of the desk clerk, as muted, polite and deprecating as it well might
    be, informed him that he was under detention at the orders of the Commission of Public Safety.

    Gaal sprang to the door and found it would no longer open. He could only dress and wait.

    They came for him and took him elsewhere, but it was still detention. They asked him questions
    most politely. It was all very civilized. He explained that he was a provincial of Synnax; that he
    had attended such and such schools and obtained a Doctor of Mathematics degree on such
    and such a date. He had applied for a position on Dr. Seldon's staff and had been accepted.
    Over and over again, he gave these details; and over and over again, they returned to the
    question of his joining the Seldon Project. How had he heard of it; what were to be his duties;
    what secret instructions had he received; what was it all about?

    He answered that he did not know. He had no secret instructions. He was a scholar and a
    mathematician. He had no interest in politics.

    And finally the gentle inquisitor asked, "When will Trantor be destroyed?"

    Gaal faltered, "I could not say of my own knowledge."

    "Could you say of anyone's?"

    "How could I speak for another?" He felt warm; overwarm.

    The inquisitor said, "Has anyone told you of such destruction; set a date?" And, as the young
    man hesitated, he went on, "You have been followed, doctor. We were at the airport when you
    arrived; on the observation tower when you waited for your appointment; and, of course, we
    were able to overhear your conversation with Dr. Seldon."

    Gaal said, "Then you know his views on the matter."

    "Perhaps. But we would like to hear them from you."

    "He is of the opinion that Trantor would be destroyed within three centuries."

    "He proved it, - uh - mathematically?"

    "Yes, he did," - defiantly.



    "You maintain the - uh - mathematics to be valid, I suppose.

    "If Dr. Seldon vouches for it, it is valid."

    "Then we will return."

    "Wait. I have a right to a lawyer. I demand my rights as an Imperial citizen."

    "You shall have them."

    And he did.

    It was a tall man that eventually entered, a man whose face seemed all vertical lines and so
    thin that one could wonder whether there was room for a smile.

    Gaal looked up. He felt disheveled and wilted. So much had happened, yet he had been on
    Trantor not more than thirty hours.

    The man said, "I am Lors Avakim. Dr. Seldon has directed me to represent you."

    "Is that so? Well, then, look here. I demand an instant appeal to the Emperor. I'm being held
    without cause. I'm innocent of anything. Of anything." He slashed his hands outward, palms
    down, "You've got to arrange a hearing with the Emperor, instantly."

    Avakim was carefully emptying the contents of a flat folder onto the floor. If Gaal had had the
    stomach for it, he might have recognized Cellomet legal forms, metal thin and tapelike, adapted
    for insertion within the smallness of a personal capsule. He might also have recognized a
    pocket recorder.

    Avakim, paying no attention to Gaal's outburst, finally looked up. He said, "The Commission
    will, of course, have a spy beam on our conversation. This is against the law, but they will use
    one nevertheless."

    Gaal ground his teeth.

    "However," and Avakim seated himself deliberately, "the recorder I have on the table, - which
    is a perfectly ordinary recorder to all appearances and performs it duties well - has the
    additional property of completely blanketing the spy beam. This is something they will not find
    out at once."

    "Then I can speak."

    "Of course."

    "Then I want a hearing with the Emperor."

    Avakim smiled frostily, and it turned out that there was room for it on his thin face after all. His
    cheeks wrinkled to make the room. He said, "You are from the provinces."

    "I am none the less an Imperial citizen. As good a one as you or as any of this Commission of
    Public Safety."

    "No doubt; no doubt. It is merely that, as a provincial, you do not understand life on Trantor as it



    is, There are no hearings before the Emperor."

    "To whom else would one appeal from this Commission? Is there other procedure?"

    "None. There is no recourse in a practical sense. Legalistically, you may appeal to the
    Emperor, but you would get no hearing. The Emperor today is not the Emperor of an Entun
    dynasty, you know. Trantor, I am afraid is in the hands of the aristocratic families, members of
    which compose the Commission of Public Safety. This is a development which is well predicted
    by psychohistory."

    Gaal said, "Indeed? In that case, if Dr. Seldon can predict the history of Trantor three hundred
    years into the future

    "He can predict it fifteen hundred years into the future."

    "Let it be fifteen thousand. Why couldn't he yesterday have predicted the events of this morning
    and warned me. -No, I'm sorry." Gaal sat down and rested his head in one sweating palm, "I
    quite understand that psychohistory is a statistical science and cannot predict the future of a
    single man with any accuracy. You'll understand that I'm upset."

    "But you are wrong. Dr. Seldon was of the opinion that you would be arrested this morning."
    "What!"

    "It is unfortunate, but true. The Commission has been more and more hostile to his activities.
    New members joining the group have been interfered with to an increasing extent. The graphs
    showed that for our purposes, matters might best be brought to a climax now. The Commission
    of itself was moving somewhat slowly so Dr. Seldon visited you yesterday for the purpose of
    forcing their hand. No other reason."

    Gaal caught his breath, "I resent-"

    "Please. It was necessary. You were not picked for any personal reasons. You must realize that
    Dr. Seldon's plans, which are laid out with the developed mathematics of over eighteen years
    include all eventualities with significant probabilities. This is one of them. I've been sent here for
    no other purpose than to assure you that you need not fear. It will end well; almost certainly so
    for the project; and with reasonable probability for you."

    "What are the figures?" demanded Gaal.

    "For the project, over 99.9%."

    "And for myself?"

    "I am instructed that this probability is 77.2%."

    "Then I've got better than one chance in five of being sentenced to prison or to death."

    "The last is under one per cent."

    "Indeed. Calculations upon one man mean nothing. You send Dr. Seldon to me."



    "Unfortunately, I cannot. Dr. Seldon is himself arrested."

    The door was thrown open before the rising Gaal could do more than utter the beginning of a
    cry. A guard entered, walked to the table, picked up the recorder, looked upon all sides of it and
    put it in his pocket.

    Avakim said quietly, "I will need that instrument."

    "We will supply you with one, Counsellor, that does not cast a static field."

    "My interview is done, in that case."

    Gaal watched him leave and was alone.


    6 .

    The trial (Gaal supposed it to be one, though it bore little resemblance legalistically to the
    elaborate trial techniques Gaal had read of) had not lasted long. It was in its third day. Yet
    already, Gaal could no longer stretch his memory back far enough to embrace its beginning.

    He himself had been but little pecked at. The heavy guns were trained on Dr. Seldon himself.
    Hari Seldon, however, sat there unperturbed. To Gaal, he was the only spot of stability
    remaining in the world.

    The audience was small and drawn exclusively from among the Barons of the Empire. Press
    and public were excluded and it was doubtful that any significant number of outsiders even
    knew that a trial of Seldon was being conducted. The atmosphere was one of unrelieved
    hostility toward the defendants.

    Five of the Commission of Public Safety sat behind the raised desk. They wore scarlet and gold
    uniforms and the shining, close-fitting plastic caps that were the sign of their judicial function. In
    the center was the Chief Commissioner Linge Chen. Gaal had never before seen so great a
    Lord and he watched him with fascination. Chen, throughout the trial, rarely said a word. He
    made it quite clear that much speech was beneath his dignity.

    The Commission's Advocate consulted his notes and the examination continued, with Seldon
    still on the stand:

    Q. Let us see, Dr. Seldon. How many men are now engaged in the project of which you are
    head?

    A. Fifty mathematicians.

    Q. Including Dr. Gaal Dornick?

    A. Dr. Dornick is the fifty-first,

    Q. Oh, we have fifty-one then? Search your memory, Dr. Seldon. Perhaps there are fifty-two or
    fifty-three? Or perhaps even more?



    A. Dr. Dornick has not yet formally joined my organization. When he does, the membership will
    be fifty-one. It is now fifty, as I have said.

    Q. Not perhaps nearly a hundred thousand?

    A. Mathematicians? No.

    Q. I did not say mathematicians. Are there a hundred thousand in all capacities?

    A. In all capacities, your figure may be correct.

    Q. May be? I say it is. I say that the men in your project number ninety-eight thousand, five
    hundred and seventy-two.

    A. I believe you are counting women and children.

    Q. (raising his voice) Ninety eight thousand five hundred and seventy-two individuals is the
    intent of my statement. There is no need to quibble.

    A. I accept the figures.

    Q. (referring to his notes) Let us drop that for the moment, then, and take up another matter
    which we have already discussed at some length. Would you repeat, Dr. Seldon, your thoughts
    concerning the future of Trantor?

    A. I have said, and I say again, that Trantor will lie in ruins within the next three centuries.

    Q. You do not consider your statement a disloyal one?

    A. No, sir. Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.

    Q. You are sure that your statement represents scientific truth?

    A. I am.

    Q. On what basis?

    A. On the basis of the mathematics of psychohistory.

    Q. Can you prove that this mathematics is valid'?

    A. Only to another mathematician.

    Q. (with a smile) Your claim then is that your truth is of so esoteric a nature that it is beyond the
    understanding of a plain man. It seems to me that truth should be clearer than that, less
    mysterious, more open to the mind.

    A. It presents no difficulties to some minds. The physics of energy transfer, which we know as
    thermodynamics, has been clear and true through all the history of man since the mythical
    ages, yet there may be people present who would find it impossible to design a power engine.
    People of high intelligence, too. I doubt if the learned Commissioners-

    At this point, one of the Commissioners leaned toward the Advocate. His words were not heard



    but the hissing of the voice carried a certain asperity. The Advocate flushed and interrupted
    Seldon.

    Q. We are not here to listen to speeches, Dr. Seldon. Let us assume that you have made your
    point. Let me suggest to you that your predictions of disaster might be intended to destroy
    public confidence in the Imperial Government for purposes of your own.

    A. That is not so.

    Q. Let me suggest that you intend to claim that a period of time preceding the so-called ruin of
    Trantor will be filled with unrest of various types.

    A. That is correct.

    Q. And that by the mere prediction thereof, you hope to bring it about, and to have then an
    army of a hundred thousand available.

    A. In the first place, that is not so. And if it were, investigation will show you that barely ten
    thousand are men of military age, and none of these has training in arms.

    Q. Are you acting as an agent for another?

    A. I am not in the pay of any man, Mr. Advocate.

    Q. You are entirely disinterested? You are serving science?

    A. I am.

    Q. Then let us see how. Can the future be changed, Dr. Seldon?

    A. Obviously. This courtroom may explode in the next few hours, or it may not. If it did, the
    future would undoubtedly be changed in some minor respects.

    Q. You quibble, Dr. Seldon. Can the overall history of the human race be changed?

    A. Yes.

    Q. Easily?

    A. No. With great difficulty.

    Q. Why?

    A. The psychohistoric trend of a planet-full of people contains a huge inertia. To be changed it
    must be met with something possessing a similar inertia. Either as many people must be
    concerned, or if the number of people be relatively small, enormous time for change must be
    allowed. Do you understand?

    Q. I think I do. Trantor need not be ruined, if a great many people decide to act so that it will
    not.


    A. That is right.



    Q. As many as a hundred thousand people?

    A. No, sir. That is far too few.

    Q. You are sure?

    A. Consider that Trantor has a population of over forty billions. Consider further that the trend
    leading to ruin does not belong to Trantor alone but to the Empire as a whole and the Empire
    contains nearly a quintillion human beings.

    Q. I see. Then perhaps a hundred thousand people can change the trend, if they and their
    descendants labor for three hundred years.

    A. I'm afraid not. Three hundred years is too short a time.

    Q. Ah! In that case, Dr. Seldon, we are left with this deduction to be made from your
    statements. You have gathered one hundred thousand people within the confines of your
    project. These are insufficient to change the history of Trantor within three hundred years. In
    other words, they cannot prevent the destruction of Trantor no matter what they do.

    A. You are unfortunately correct.

    Q. And on the other hand, your hundred thousand are intended for no illegal purpose.

    A. Exactly.

    Q. (slowly and with satisfaction) In that case, Dr. Seldon- Now attend, sir, most carefully, for we
    want a considered answer. What is the purpose of your hundred thousand?

    The Advocate's voice had grown strident. He had sprung his trap; backed Seldon into a comer;
    driven him astutely from any possibility of answering.

    There was a rising buzz of conversation at that which swept the ranks of the peers in the
    audience and invaded even the row of Commissioners. They swayed toward one another in
    their scarlet and gold, only the Chief remaining uncorrupted.

    Hari Seldon remained unmoved. He waited for the babble to evaporate.

    A. To minimize the effects of that destruction.

    Q. And exactly what do you mean by that?

    A. The explanation is simple. The coming destruction of Trantor is not an event in itself, isolated
    in the scheme of human development. It will be the climax to an intricate drama which was
    begun centuries ago and which is accelerating in pace continuously. I refer, gentlemen, to the
    developing decline and fall of the Galactic Empire.

    The buzz now became a dull roar. The Advocate, unheeded, was yelling, "You are openly
    declaring that-" and stopped because the cries of "Treason" from the audience showed that the
    point had been made without any hammering.

    Slowly, the Chief Commissioner raised his gavel once and let it drop. The sound was that of a



    mellow gong. When the reverberations ceased, the gabble of the audience also did. The
    Advocate took a deep breath.

    Q. (theatrically) Do you realize, Dr. Seldon, that you are speaking of an Empire that has stood
    for twelve thousand years, through all the vicissitudes of the generations, and which has behind
    it the good wishes and love of a quadrillion human beings?

    A. I am aware both of the present status and the past history of the Empire. Without disrespect,

    I must claim a far better knowledge of it than any in this room.

    Q. And you predict its ruin?

    A. It is a prediction which is made by mathematics. I pass no moral judgements. Personally, I
    regret the prospect. Even if the Empire were admitted to be a bad thing (an admission I do not
    make), the state of anarchy which would follow its fall would be worse. It is that state of anarchy
    which my project is pledged to fight. The fall of Empire, gentlemen, is a massive thing,
    however, and not easily fought. It is dictated by a rising bureaucracy, a receding initiative, a
    freezing of caste, a damming of curiosity - a hundred other factors. It has been going on, as I
    have said, for centuries, and it is too majestic and massive a movement to stop.

    Q. Is it not obvious to anyone that the Empire is as strong as it ever was?

    A. The appearance of strength is all about you. It would seem to last forever. However, Mr.
    Advocate, the rotten tree-trunk, until the very moment when the storm-blast breaks it in two,
    has all the appearance of might it ever had. The storm-blast whistles through the branches of
    the Empire even now. Listen with the ears of psychohistory, and you will hear the creaking.

    Q. (uncertainly) We are not here, Dr. Seldon, to lis—

    A. (firmly) The Empire will vanish and all its good with it. Its accumulated knowledge will decay
    and the order it has imposed will vanish. Interstellar wars will be endless; interstellar trade will
    decay; population will decline; worlds will lose touch with the main body of the Galaxy. -And so
    matters will remain.

    Q. (a small voice in the middle of a vast silence) Forever?

    A. Psychohistory, which can predict the fall, can make statements concerning the succeeding
    dark ages. The Empire, gentlemen, as has just been said, has stood twelve thousand years.
    The dark ages to come will endure not twelve, but thirty thousand years. A Second Empire will
    rise, but between it and our civilization will be one thousand generations of suffering humanity.
    We must fight that.

    Q. (recovering somewhat) You contradict yourself. You said earlier that you could not prevent
    the destruction of Trantor; hence, presumably, the fall; -the so-called fall of the Empire.

    A. I do not say now that we can prevent the fall. But it is not yet too late to shorten the
    interregnum which will follow. It is possible, gentlemen, to reduce the duration of anarchy to a
    single millennium, if my group is allowed to act now. We are at a delicate moment in history.
    The huge, onrushing mass of events must be deflected just a little, - just a little - It cannot be
    much, but it may be enough to remove twenty-nine thousand years of misery from human



    history.

    Q. How do you propose to do this?

    A. By saving the knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is beyond any one man;
    any thousand men. With the destruction of our social fabric, science will be broken into a million
    pieces. Individuals will know much of exceedingly tiny facets of what there is to know. They will
    be helpless and useless by themselves. The bits of lore, meaningless, will not be passed on.
    They will be lost through the generations. But, if we now prepare a giant summary of all
    knowledge, it will never be lost. Coming generations will build on it, and will not have to
    rediscover it for themselves. One millennium will do the work of thirty thousand.

    Q. All this

    A. All my project; my thirty thousand men with their wives and children, are devoting
    themselves to the preparation of an "Encyclopedia Galactica." They will not complete it in their
    lifetimes. I will not even live to see it fairly begun. But by the time Trantor falls, it will be
    complete and copies will exist in every major library in the Galaxy.

    The Chief Commissioner's gavel rose and fell. Hari Seldon left the stand and quietly took his
    seat next to Gaal.

    He smiled and said, "How did you like the show?"

    Gaal said, "You stole it. But what will happen now?"

    "They'll adjourn the trial and try to come to a private agreement with me."

    "How do you know?"

    Seldon said, "I'll be honest. I don't know. It depends on the Chief Commissioner. I have studied
    him for years. I have tried to analyze his workings, but you know how risky it is to introduce the
    vagaries of an individual in the psychohistoric equations. Yet I have hopes."


    7 .

    Avakim approached, nodded to Gaal, leaned over to whisper to Seldon. The cry of adjournment
    rang out, and guards separated them. Gaal was led away.

    The next day's hearings were entirely different. Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick were alone with
    the Commission. They were seated at a table together, with scarcely a separation between the
    five judges and the two accused. They were even offered cigars from a box of iridescent plastic
    which had the appearance of water, endlessly flowing. The eyes were fooled into seeing the
    motion although the fingers reported it to be hard and dry.

    Seldon accepted one; Gaal refused.

    Seldon said, "My lawyer is not present."

    A Commissioner replied, "This is no longer a trial, Dr. Seldon. We are here to discuss the safety



    of the State.


    Linge Chen said, "I will speak," and the other Commissioners sat back in their chairs, prepared
    to listen. A silence formed about Chen into which he might drop his words.

    Gaal held his breath. Chen, lean and hard, older in looks than in fact, was the actual Emperor
    of all the Galaxy. The child who bore the title itself was only a symbol manufactured by Chen,
    and not the first such, either.

    Chen said, "Dr. Seldon, you disturb the peace of the Emperor's realm. None of the quadrillions
    living now among all the stars of the Galaxy will be living a century from now. Why, then, should
    we concern ourselves with events of three centuries distance?"

    "I shall not be alive half a decade hence," said Seldon, and yet it is of overpowering concern to
    me. Call it idealism. Call it an identification of myself with that mystical generalization to which
    we refer by the term, 'humanity.'"

    "I do not wish to take the trouble to understand mysticism. Can you tell me why I may not rid
    myself of you, and of an uncomfortable and unnecessary three-century future which I will never
    see by having you executed tonight?"

    "A week ago," said Seldon, lightly, "you might have done so and perhaps retained a one in ten
    probability of yourself remaining alive at year's end. Today, the one in ten probability is scarcely
    one in ten thousand."

    There were expired breaths in the gathering and uneasy stirrings. Gaal felt the short hairs
    prickle on the back of his neck. Chen's upper eyelids dropped a little.

    "How so?" he said.

    "The fall of Trantor," said Seldon, "cannot be stopped by any conceivable effort. It can be
    hastened easily, however. The tale of my interrupted trial will spread through the Galaxy.
    Frustration of my plans to lighten the disaster will convince people that the future holds no
    promise to them. Already they recall the lives of their grandfathers with envy. They will see that
    political revolutions and trade stagnations will increase. The feeling will pervade the Galaxy that
    only what a man can grasp for himself at that moment will be of any account. Ambitious men
    will not wait and unscrupulous men will not hang back. By their every action they will hasten the
    decay of the worlds. Have me killed and Trantor will fall not within three centuries but within fifty
    years and you, yourself, within a single year."

    Chen said, "These are words to frighten children, and yet your death is not the only answer
    which will satisfy us."

    He lifted his slender hand from the papers on which it rested, so that only two fingers touched
    lightly upon the topmost sheet.

    "Tell me," he said, "will your only activity be that of preparing this encyclopedia you speak of?"
    "It will."

    "And need that be done on Trantor?"



    "Trantor, my lord, possesses the Imperial Library, as well as the scholarly resources of the
    University of Trantor."

    "And yet if you were located elsewhere- , let us say upon a planet where the hurry and
    distractions of a metropolis will not interfere with scholastic musings; where your men may
    devote themselves entirely and single-mindedly to their work; -might not that have
    advantages?"

    "Minor ones, perhaps."

    "Such a world had been chosen, then. You may work, doctor, at your leisure, with your hundred
    thousand about you. The Galaxy will know that you are working and fighting the Fall. They will
    even be told that you will prevent the Fall." Fie smiled, "Since I do not believe in so many things,
    it is not difficult for me to disbelieve in the Fall as well, so that I am entirely convinced I will be
    telling the truth to the people. And meanwhile, doctor, you will not trouble Trantor and there will
    be no disturbance of the Emperor's peace.

    "The alternative is death for yourself and for as many of your followers as will seem necessary.
    Your earlier threats I disregard. The opportunity for choosing between death and exile is given
    you over a time period stretching from this moment to one five minutes hence."

    "Which is the world chosen, my lord?" said Seldon.

    "It is called, I believe, Terminus," said Chen. Negligently, he turned the papers upon his desk
    with his fingertips so that they faced Seldon. "It is uninhabited, but quite habitable, and can be
    molded to suit the necessities of scholars. It is somewhat secluded-"

    Seldon interrupted, "It is at the edge of the Galaxy, sir."

    "As I have said, somewhat secluded. It will suit your needs for concentration. Come, you have
    two minutes left."

    Seldon said, "We will need time to arrange such a trip. There are twenty thousand families
    involved."

    "You will be given time."

    Seldon thought a moment, and the last minute began to die. Fie said, "I accept exile."

    Gaal's heart skipped a beat at the words. For the most part, he was filled with a tremendous joy
    for who would not be, to escape death. Yet in all his vast relief, he found space for a little regret
    that Seldon had been defeated.


    8 .

    For a long while, they sat silently as the taxi whined through the hundreds of miles of worm-like
    tunnels toward the University. And then Gaal stirred. Fie said:

    "Was what you told the Commissioner true? Would your execution have really hastened the



    Fall?


    Seldon said, "I never lie about psychohistoric findings. Nor would it have availed me in this
    case. Chen knew I spoke the truth. He is a very clever politician and politicians by the very
    nature of their work must have an instinctive feeling for the truths of psychohistory."

    "Then need you have accepted exile," Gaal wondered, but Seldon did not answer.

    When they burst out upon the University grounds, Gaal's muscles took action of their own; or
    rather, inaction. He had to be carried, almost, out of the taxi.

    All the University was a blaze of light. Gaal had almost forgotten that a sun could exist.

    The University structures lacked the hard steel-gray of the rest of Trantor. They were silvery,
    rather. The metallic luster was almost ivory in color.

    Seldon said, "Soldiers, it seems."

    "What?" Gaal brought his eyes to the prosaic ground and found a sentinel ahead of them.

    They stopped before him, and a soft-spoken captain materialized from a near-by doorway.

    He said, "Dr. Seldon?"

    "Yes."

    "We have been waiting for you. You and your men will be under martial law henceforth. I have
    been instructed to inform you that six months will be allowed you for preparations to leave for
    Terminus."

    "Six months!" began Gaal, but Seldon's fingers were upon his elbow with gentle pressure.
    "These are my instructions," repeated the captain.

    He was gone, and Gaal turned to Seldon, "Why, what can be done in six months? This is but
    slower murder."

    "Quietly. Quietly. Let us reach my office."

    It was not a large office, but it was quite spy-proof and quite undetectably so. Spy-beams
    trained upon it received neither a suspicious silence nor an even more suspicious static. They
    received, rather, a conversation constructed at random out of a vast stock of innocuous
    phrases in various tones and voices.

    "Now," said Seldon, at his ease, "six months will be enough."

    "I don't see how."

    "Because, my boy, in a plan such as ours, the actions of others are bent to our needs. Have I
    not said to you already that Chen's temperamental makeup has been subjected to greater
    scrutiny than that of any other single man in history. The trial was not allowed to begin until the
    time and circumstances were fight for the ending of our own choosing."



    "But could you have arranged-"

    "-to be exiled to Terminus? Why not?" He put his fingers on a certain spot on his desk and a
    small section of the wall behind him slid aside. Only his own fingers could have done so, since
    only his particular print-pattern could have activated the scanner beneath.

    "You will find several microfilms inside," said Seldon. "Take the one marked with the letter, T."

    Gaal did so and waited while Seldon fixed it within the projector and handed the young man a
    pair of eyepieces. Gaal adjusted them, and watched the film unroll before his eyes.

    He said, "But then-"

    Seldon said, "What surprises you?"

    "Have you been preparing to leave for two years?"

    "Two and a half. Of course, we could not be certain that it would be Terminus he would choose,
    but we hoped it might be and we acted upon that assumption-"

    "But why, Dr. Seldon? If you arranged the exile, why? Could not events be far better controlled
    here on Trantor?"

    "Why, there are some reasons. Working on Terminus, we will have Imperial support without
    ever rousing fears that we would endanger Imperial safety."

    Gaal said, "But you aroused those fears only to force exile. I still do not understand."

    "Twenty thousand families would not travel to the end of the Galaxy of their own will perhaps."

    "But why should they be forced there?" Gaal paused, "May I not know?"

    Seldon said, "Not yet. It is enough for the moment that you know that a scientific refuge will be
    established on Terminus. And another will be established at the other end of the Galaxy, let us
    say," and he smiled, "at Star's End. And as for the rest, I will die soon, and you will see more
    than I. -No, no. Spare me your shock and good wishes. My doctors tell me that I cannot live
    longer than a year or two. But then, I have accomplished in life what I have intended and under
    what circumstances may one better die."

    "And after you die, sir?"

    "Why, there will be successors - perhaps even yourself. And these successors will be able to
    apply the final touch in the scheme and instigate the revolt on Anacreon at the right time and in
    the right manner. Thereafter, events may roll unheeded."

    "I do not understand."

    "You will." Seldon's lined face grew peaceful and tired, both at once, "Most will leave for
    Terminus, but some will stay. It will be easy to arrange. -But as for me," and he concluded in a
    whisper, so that Gaal could scarcely hear him, "I am finished."



    PART II

    THE ENCYCLOPEDISTS

    i.

    TERMINUS-... Its location (see map) was an odd one for the role It was called upon to play In
    Galactic history, and yet as many writers have never tired of pointing out, an Inevitable one.
    Located on the very fringe of the Galactic spiral, an only planet of an Isolated sun, poor In
    resources and negligible In economic value, it was never settled In the five centuries after Its
    discovery, until the landing of the Encyclopedists....

    It was inevitable that as a new generation grew, Terminus would become something more than
    an appendage of the psychohistorians of Trantor. With the Anacreonian revolt and the rise to
    power of Salvor Hardin, first of the great line of...

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Lewis Pirenne was busily engaged at his desk in the one well-lit comer of the room. Work had
    to be co-ordinated. Effort had to be organized. Threads had to be woven into a pattern.

    Fifty years now; fifty years to establish themselves and set up Encyclopedia Foundation
    Number One into a smoothly working unit. Fifty years to gather the raw material. Fifty years to
    prepare.

    It had been done. Five more years would see the publication of the first volume of the most
    monumental work the Galaxy had ever conceived. And then at ten-year intervals - regularly -
    like clockwork - volume after volume. And with them there would be supplements; special
    articles on events of current interest, until—

    Pirenne stirred uneasily, as the muted buzzer upon his desk muttered peevishly. Fie had almost
    forgotten the appointment. Fie shoved the door release and out of an abstracted comer of one
    eye saw the door open and the broad figure of Salvor FHardin enter. Pirenne did not look up.

    Hardin smiled to himself. He was in a hurry, but he knew better than to take offense at
    Pirenne's cavalier treatment of anything or anyone that disturbed him at his work. He buried
    himself in the chair on the other side of the desk and waited.

    Pirenne's stylus made the faintest scraping sound as it raced across paper. Otherwise, neither
    motion nor sound. And then Hardin withdrew a two-credit coin from his vest pocket. He flipped
    it and its stainless-steel surface caught flitters of light as it tumbled through the air. He caught it
    and-flipped it again, watching the flashing reflections lazily. Stainless steel made good medium
    of exchange on a planet where all metal had to be imported.

    Pirenne looked up and blinked. "Stop that!" he said querulously.

    "Eh?"



    "That infernal coin tossing. Stop it."

    "Oh." Hardin pocketed the metal disk. "Tell me when you're ready, will you? I promised to be
    back at the City Council meeting before the new aqueduct project is put to a vote."

    Pirenne sighed and shoved himself away from the desk. "I'm ready. But I hope you aren't going
    to bother me with city affairs. Take care of that yourself, please. The Encyclopedia takes up all
    my time."

    "Have you heard the news?" questioned Hardin, phlegmatically.

    "What news?"

    "The news that the Terminus City ultrawave set received two hours ago. The Royal Governor of
    the Prefect of Anacreon has assumed the title of king."

    "Well? What of it?"

    "It means," responded Hardin, "that we're cut off from the inner regions of the Empire. We've
    been expecting it but that doesn't make it any more comfortable. Anacreon stands square
    across what was our last remaining trade route to Santanni and to Trantor and to Vega itself.
    Where is our metal to come from? We haven't managed to get a steel or aluminum shipment
    through in six months and now we won't be able to get any at all, except by grace of the King of
    Anacreon."

    Pirenne tch-tched impatiently. "Get them through him, then."

    "But can we? Listen, Pirenne, according to the charter which established this Foundation, the
    Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee has been given full administrative powers. I,
    as Mayor of Terminus City, have just enough power to blow my own nose and perhaps to
    sneeze if you countersign an order giving me permission. It's up to you and your Board then.

    I'm asking you in the name of the City, whose prosperity depends upon uninterrupted
    commerce with the Galaxy, to call an emergency meeting-"

    "Stop! A campaign speech is out of order. Now, Hardin, the Board of Trustees has not barred
    the establishment of a municipal government on Terminus. We understand one to be
    necessary because of the increase in population since the Foundation was established fifty
    years ago, and because of the increasing number of people involved in non-Encyclopedia
    affairs. But that does not mean that the first and only aim of the Foundation is no longer to
    publish the definitive Encyclopedia of all human knowledge. We are a State-supported,
    scientific institution, Hardin. We cannot - must not -will not interfere in local politics."

    "Local politics! By the Emperor's left toe, Pirenne, this is a matter of life and death. The planet,
    Terminus, by itself cannot support a mechanized civilization. It lacks metals. You know that. It
    hasn't a trace of iron, copper, or aluminum in the surface rocks, and precious little of anything
    else. What do you think will happen to the Encyclopedia if this watchmacallum King of
    Anacreon clamps down on us?"

    "On us? Are you forgetting that we are under the direct control of the Emperor himself? We are
    not part of the Prefect of Anacreon or of any other prefect. Memorize that! We are part of the



    Emperor's personal domain, and no one touches us. The Empire can protect its own."

    "Then why didn't it prevent the Royal Governor of Anacreon from kicking over the traces? And
    only Anacreon?

    At least twenty of the outermost prefects of the Galaxy, the entire Periphery as a matter of fact,
    have begun steering things their own way. I tell you I feel damned uncertain of the Empire and
    its ability to protect us."

    "Hokum! Royal Governors, Kings - what's the difference? The Empire is always shot through
    with a certain amount of politics and with different men pulling this way and that. Governors
    have rebelled, and, for that matter, Emperors have been deposed, or assassinated before this.
    But what has that to do with the Empire itself? Forget it, Hardin. It's none of our business. We
    are first of all and last of all-scientists. And our concern is the Encyclopedia.

    Oh, yes, I'd almost forgotten. Hardin!"

    "Well?"

    "Do something about that paper of yours!" Pirenne's voice was angry.

    "The Terminus City Journal? It isn't mine; it's privately owned. What's it been doing?"

    "For weeks now it has been recommending that the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of
    the Foundation be made the occasion for public holidays and quite inappropriate celebrations."

    "And why not? The computoclock will open the Vault in three months. I would call this first
    opening a big occasion, wouldn't you?"

    "Not for silly pageantry, Hardin. The Vault and its opening concern the Board of Trustees alone.
    Anything of importance will be communicated to the people. That is final and please make it
    plain to the Journal."

    "I'm sorry, Pirenne, but the City Charter guarantees a certain minor matter known as freedom of
    the press."

    "It may. But the Board of Trustees does not. I am the Emperor's representative on Terminus,
    Hardin, and have full powers in this respect."

    Hardin's expression became that of a man counting to ten, mentally. He said, grimly: "in
    connection with your status as Emperor's representative, then, I have a final piece of news to
    give you."

    "About Anacreon?" Pirenne's lips tightened. He felt annoyed.

    "Yes. A special envoy will be sent to us from Anacreon. In two weeks."

    "An envoy? Here? From Anacreon?" Pirenne chewed that. "What for?"

    Hardin stood up, and shoved his chair back up against the desk. "I give you one guess." And
    he left - quite unceremoniously.



    2 .


    Anselm haut Rodric - "haut" itself signifying noble blood -Sub-prefect of Pluema and Envoy
    Extraordinary of his Highness of Anacreon-plus half a dozen other titleswas met by Salvor
    Hardin at the spaceport with all the imposing ritual of a state occasion.

    With a tight smile and a low bow, the sub-prefect had flipped his blaster from its holster and
    presented it to Hardin butt first. Hardin returned the compliment with, a blaster specifically
    borrowed for the occasion. Friendship and good will were thus established, and if Hardin noted
    the barest bulge at Haut Rodric's shoulder, he prudently said nothing.

    The ground car that received them then - preceded, flanked, and followed by the suitable cloud
    of minor functionaries - proceeded in a slow, ceremonious manner to Cyclopedia Square,
    cheered on its way by a properly enthusiastic crowd.

    Sub-prefect Anselm received the cheers with the complaisant indifference of a soldier and a
    nobleman.

    He said to Hardin, "And this city is all your world?"

    Hardin raised his voice to be heard above the clamor. "We are a young world, your eminence.

    In our short history we have had but few members of the higher nobility visiting our poor planet.
    Hence, our enthusiasm."

    It is certain that "higher nobility" did not recognize irony when he heard it.

    He said thoughtfully: "Founded fifty years ago. Hm-m-m! You have a great deal of unexploited
    land here, mayor. You have never considered dividing it into estates?"

    "There is no necessity as yet. We're extremely centralized; we have to be, because of the
    Encyclopedia. Someday, perhaps, when our population has grown-"

    "A strange world! You have no peasantry?"

    Hardin reflected that it didn't require a great deal of acumen to tell that his eminence was
    indulging in a bit of fairly clumsy pumping. He replied casually, "No - nor nobility."

    Haut Rodric's eyebrows lifted. "And your leader -the man I am to meet?"

    "You mean Dr. Pirenne? Yes! He is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees - and a personal
    representative of the Emperor."

    "Doctor? No other title? A scholar? And he rates above the civil authority?"

    "Why, certainly," replied Hardin, amiably. "We're all scholars more or less. After all, we're not so
    much a world as a scientific foundation - under the direct control of the Emperor."

    There was a faint emphasis upon the last phrase that seemed to disconcert the sub-prefect. He
    remained thoughtfully silent during the rest of the slow way to Cyclopedia Square.



    If Hardin found himself bored by the afternoon and evening that followed, he had at least the
    satisfaction of realizing that Pirenne and Haut Rodric - having met with loud and mutual
    protestations of esteem and regard - were detesting each other's company a good deal more.

    Haut Rodric had attended with glazed eye to Pirenne's lecture during the "inspection tour" of
    the Encyclopedia Building. With polite and vacant smile, he had listened to the latter's rapid
    patter as they passed through the vast storehouses of reference films and the numerous
    projection rooms.

    It was only after he had gone down level by level into and through the composing departments,
    editing departments, publishing departments, and filming departments that he made the first
    comprehensive statement.

    "This is all very interesting," he said, "but it seems a strange occupation for grown men. What
    good is it?"

    It was a remark, Hardin noted, for which Pirenne found no answer, though the expression of his
    face was most eloquent.

    The dinner that evening was much the mirror image of the events of that afternoon, for Haut
    Rodric monopolized the conversation by describing - in minute technical detail and with
    incredible zest - his own exploits as battalion head during the recent war between Anacreon
    and the neighboring newly proclaimed Kingdom of Smyrno.

    The details of the sub-prefect's account were not completed until dinner was over and one by
    one the minor officials had drifted away. The last bit of triumphant description of mangled
    spaceships came when he had accompanied Pirenne and Hardin onto the balcony and relaxed
    in the warm air of the summer evening.

    "And now," he said, with a heavy joviality, "to serious matters."

    "By all means," murmured Hardin, lighting a long cigar of Vegan tobacco - not many left, he
    reflected - and teetering his chair back on two legs.

    The Galaxy was high in the sky and its misty lens shape stretched lazily from horizon to
    horizon. The few stars here at the very edge of the universe were insignificant twinkles in
    comparison.

    "Of course," said the sub-prefect, "all the formal discussions - the paper signing and such dull
    technicalities, that is - will take place before the - What is it you call your Council?"

    "The Board of Trustees," replied Pirenne, coldly.

    "Queer name! Anyway, that's for tomorrow. We might as well clear away some of the
    underbrush, man to man, right now, though. Hey?"

    "And this means-" prodded Hardin.

    "Just this. There's been a certain change in the situation out here in the Periphery and the
    status of your planet has become a trifle uncertain. It would be very convenient if we succeeded
    in coming to an understanding as to how the matter stands. By the way, mayor, have you



    another one of those cigars?"

    Hardin started and produced one reluctantly.

    Anselm haut Rodric sniffed at it and emitted a clucking sound of pleasure. "Vegan tobacco!
    Where did you get it?"

    "We received some last shipment. There's hardly any left. Space knows when we'll get more -
    if ever."

    Pirenne scowled. He didn't smoke - and, for that matter, detested the odor. "Let me understand
    this, your eminence. Your mission is merely one of clarification?"

    Haut Rodric nodded through the smoke of his first lusty puffs.

    "In that case, it is soon over. The situation with respect to the Encyclopedia Foundation is what
    it always has been."

    "Ah! And what is it that it always has been?"

    "Just this: A State-supported scientific institution and part of the personal domain of his august
    majesty, the Emperor."

    The sub-prefect seemed unimpressed. He blew smoke rings. "That's a nice theory, Dr. Pirenne.
    I imagine you've got charters with the Imperial Seal upon it - but what's the actual situation?
    How do you stand with respect to Smyrno? You're not fifty parsecs from Smyrno's capital, you
    know. And what about Konom and Daribow?"

    Pirenne said: "We have nothing to do with any prefect. As part of the Emperor's-"

    "They're not prefects," reminded Haut Rodric; "they're kingdoms now."

    "Kingdoms then. We have nothing to do with them. As a scientific institution-"

    "Science be damned!" swore the other. "What the devil has that got to do with the fact that
    we're liable to see Terminus taken over by Smyrno at any time?"

    "And the Emperor? He would just sit by?"

    Haut Rodric calmed down and said: "Well, now, Dr. Pirenne, you respect the Emperor's
    property and so does Anacreon, but Smyrno might not. Remember, we've just signed a treaty
    with the Emperor - I'll present a copy to that Board of yours tomorrow - which places upon us
    the responsibility of maintaining order within the borders of the old Prefect of Anacreon on
    behalf of the Emperor. Our duty is clear, then, isn't it?"

    "Certainly. But Terminus is not part of the Prefect of Anacreon."

    "And Smyrno-"

    "Nor is it part of the Prefect of Smyrno. It's not part of any prefect."

    "Does Smyrno know that?"



    I don't care what it knows.


    "We do. We've just finished a war with her and she still holds two stellar systems that are ours.
    Terminus occupies an extremely strategic spot, between the two nations."

    Hardin felt weary. He broke in: "What is your proposition, your eminence?"

    The sub-prefect seemed quite ready to stop fencing in favor of more direct statements. He said
    briskly: "It seems perfectly obvious that, since Terminus cannot defend itself, Anacreon must
    take over the job for its own sake. You understand we have no desire to interfere with internal
    administration-"

    "Uh-huh," grunted Hardin dryly.

    "-but we believe that it would be best for all concerned to have Anacreon establish a military
    base upon the planet."

    "And that is all you would want - a military base in some of the vast unoccupied territory - and
    let it go at that?"

    "Well, of course, there would be the matter of supporting the protecting forces."

    Hardin's chair came down on all four, and his elbows went forward on his knees. "Now we're
    getting to the nub. Let's put it into language. Terminus is to be a protectorate and to pay
    tribute."

    "Not tribute. Taxes. We're protecting you. You pay for it."

    Pirenne banged his hand on the chair with sudden violence. "Let me speak, Hardin. Your
    eminence, I don't care a rusty half-credit coin for Anacreon, Smyrno, or all your local politics
    and petty wars. I tell you this is a State-supported tax-free institution."

    "State-supported? But we are the State, Dr. Pirenne, and we're not supporting."

    Pirenne rose angrily. "Your eminence, I am the direct representative of-"

    "-his august majesty, the Emperor," chorused Anselm haut Rodric sourly, "And I am the direct
    representative of the King of Anacreon. Anacreon is a lot nearer, Dr. Pirenne. "

    "Let's get back to business," urged Hardin. "How would you take these so-called taxes, your
    eminence? Would you take them in kind: wheat, potatoes, vegetables, cattle?"

    The sub-prefect stared. "What the devil? What do we need with those? We've got hefty
    surpluses. Gold, of course. Chromium or vanadium would be even better, incidentally, if you
    have it in quantity."

    Hardin laughed. "Quantity! We haven't even got iron in quantity. Gold! Here, take a look at our
    currency." He tossed a coin to the envoy.

    Haut Rodric bounced it and stared. "What is it? Steel?"

    "That's right."



    I don't understand.


    "Terminus is a planet practically without metals. We import it all. Consequently, we have no
    gold, and nothing to pay unless you want a few thousand bushels of potatoes."

    "Well - manufactured goods."

    "Without metal? What do we make our machines out of?"

    There was a pause and Pirenne tried again. "This whole discussion is wide of the point.
    Terminus is not a planet, but a scientific foundation preparing a great encyclopedia. Space,
    man, have you no respect for science?"

    "Encyclopedias don't win wars." Haut Rodric's brows furrowed. "A completely unproductive
    world, then - and practically unoccupied at that. Well, you might pay with land."

    "What do you mean?" asked Pirenne.

    "This world is just about empty and the unoccupied land is probably fertile. There are many of
    the nobility on Anacreon that would like an addition to their estates."

    "You can't propose any such-"

    "There's no necessity of looking so alarmed, Dr. Pirenne. There's plenty for all of us. If it comes
    to what it comes, and you co-operate, we could probably arrange it so that you lose nothing.
    Titles can be conferred and estates granted. You understand me, I think."

    Pirenne sneered, "Thanks!"

    And then Hardin said ingenuously: "Could Anacreon supply us with adequate quantities of
    plutonium for our nuclear-power plant? We've only a few years' supply left."

    There was a gasp from Pirenne and then a dead silence for minutes. When Haut Rodric spoke
    it was in a voice quite different from what it had been till then:

    "You have nuclear power?"

    "Certainly. What's unusual in that? I imagine nuclear power is fifty thousand years old now.

    Why shouldn't we have it? Except that it's a little difficult to get plutonium."

    "Yes ... Yes." The envoy paused and added uncomfortably: "Well, gentlemen, we'll pursue the
    subject tomorrow. You'll excuse me-"

    Pirenne looked after him and gritted through his teeth: "That insufferable, dull-witted donkey!
    That-"

    Hardin broke in: "Not at all. He's merely the product of his environment. He doesn't understand
    much except that 'I have a gun and you haven't.’"

    Pirenne whirled on him in exasperation. "What in space did you mean by the talk about military
    bases and tribute? Are you crazy?"

    "No. I merely gave him rope and let him talk. You'll notice that he managed to stumble out with



    Anacreon's real intentions - that is, the parceling up of Terminus into landed estates. Of
    course, I don't intend to let that happen."

    "You don't intend. You don't. And who are you? And may I ask what you meant by blowing off
    your mouth about our nuclear-power plant? Why, it's just the thing that would make us a military
    target."

    "Yes," grinned Hardin. "A military target to stay away from. Isn't it obvious why I brought the
    subject up? It happened to confirm a very strong suspicion I had had."

    "And that was what?"

    "That Anacreon no longer has a nuclear-power economy. If they had, our friend would
    undoubtedly have realized that plutonium, except in ancient tradition is not used in power
    plants. And therefore it follows that the rest of the Periphery no longer has nuclear power either.
    Certainly Smyrno hasn't, or Anacreon wouldn't have won most of the battles in their recent war.
    Interesting, wouldn't you say?"

    "Bah!" Pirenne left in fiendish humor, and Hardin smiled gently.

    He threw his cigar away and looked up at the outstretched Galaxy. "Back to oil and coal, are
    they?" he murmured - and what the rest of his thoughts were he kept to himself.


    3 .

    When Hardin denied owning the Journal, he was perhaps technically correct, but no more.
    Hardin had been the leading spirit in the drive to incorporate Terminus into an autonomous
    municipality-he had been elected its first mayor-so it was not surprising that, though not a
    single share of Journal stock was in his name, some sixty percent was controlled by him in
    more devious fashions.

    There were ways.

    Consequently, when Hardin began suggesting to Pirenne that he be allowed to attend meetings
    of the Board of Trustees, it was not quite coincidence that the Journal began a similar
    campaign. And the first mass meeting in the history of the Foundation was held, demanding
    representation of the City in the "national" government.

    And, eventually, Pirenne capitulated with ill grace.

    Hardin, as he sat at the foot of the table, speculated idly as to just what it was that made
    physical scientists such poor administrators. It might be merely that they were too used to
    inflexible fact and far too unused to pliable people.

    In any case, there was Tomaz Sutt and Jord Fara on his left; Lundin Crast and Yate Fulham on
    his fight; with Pirenne, himself, presiding. He knew them all, of course, but they seemed to have
    put on an extra-special bit of pomposity for the occasion.

    Hardin had dozed through the initial formalities and then perked up when Pirenne sipped at the



    glass of water before him by way of preparation and said:

    "I find it very gratifying to be able to inform the Board that since our last meeting, I have
    received word that Lord Dorwin, Chancellor of the Empire, will arrive at Terminus in two weeks.
    It may be taken for granted that our relations with Anacreon will be smoothed out to our
    complete satisfaction as soon as the Emperor is informed of the situation. "

    He smiled and addressed Hardin across the length of the table. "Information to this effect has
    been given the Journal."

    Hardin snickered below his breath. It seemed evident that Pirenne's desire to strut this
    information before him had been one reason for his admission into the sacrosanctum.

    He said evenly: "Leaving vague expressions out of account, what do you expect Lord Dorwin to
    do?"

    Tomaz Sutt replied. He had a bad habit of addressing one in the third person when in his more
    stately moods.

    "It is quite evident," he observed, "that Mayor Hardin is a professional cynic. He can scarcely
    fail to realize that the Emperor would be most unlikely to allow his personal rights to be
    infringed."

    "Why? What would he do in case they were?"

    There was an annoyed stir. Pirenne said, "You are out of order," and, as an afterthought, "and
    are making what are near-treasonable statements, besides."

    "Am I to consider myself answered?"

    "Yes! If you have nothing further to say-"

    "Don't jump to conclusions. I'd like to ask a question. Besides this stroke of diplomacy - which
    may or may not prove to mean anything - has anything concrete been done to meet the
    Anacreonic menace?"

    Yate Fulham drew one hand along his ferocious red mustache. "You see a menace there, do
    you?"

    "Don't you?"

    "Scarcely"- this with indulgence. "The Emperor-"

    "Great space!" Hardin felt annoyed. "What is this? Every once in a while someone mentions
    'Emperor' or 'Empire' as if it were a magic word. The Emperor is thousands of parsecs away,
    and I doubt whether he gives a damn about us. And if he does, what can he do? What there
    was of the imperial navy in these regions is in the hands of the four kingdoms now and
    Anacreon has its share. Listen, we have to fight with guns, not with words.

    "Now, get this. We've had two months' grace so far, mainly because we've given Anacreon the
    idea that we've got nuclear weapons. Well, we all know that that's a little white lie. We've got



    nuclear power, but only for commercial uses, and darn little at that. They're going to find that
    out soon, and if you think they're going to enjoy being jollied along, you're mistaken."

    "My dear sir-"

    "Hold on: I'm not finished." Hardin was warming up. He liked this. "It's all very well to drag
    chancellors into this, but it would be much nicer to drag a few great big siege guns fitted for
    beautiful nuclear bombs into it. We've lost two months, gentlemen, and we may not have
    another two months to lose. What do you propose to do?"

    Said Lundin Crast, his long nose wrinkling angrily: "If you're proposing the militarization of the
    Foundation, I won't hear a word of it. It would mark our open entrance into the field of politics.
    We, Mr. Mayor, are a scientific foundation and nothing else."

    Added Sutt: "He does not realize, moreover, that building armaments would mean withdrawing
    men - valuable men - from the Encyclopedia. That cannot be done, come what may."

    "Very true," agreed Pirenne. "The Encyclopedia first - always."

    Hardin groaned in spirit. The Board seemed to suffer violently from Encyclopedia on the brain,

    He said icily: "Has it ever occurred to this Board that it is barely possible that Terminus may
    have interests other than the Encyclopedia?"

    Pirenne replied: "I do not conceive, Hardin, that the Foundation can have any interest other
    than the Encyclopedia."

    "I didn't say the Foundation; I said Terminus. I'm afraid you don't understand the situation.
    There's a good million of us here on Terminus, and not more than a hundred and fifty thousand
    are working directly on the Encyclopedia. To the rest of us, this is home. We were born here.
    We're living here. Compared with our farms and our homes and our factories, the Encyclopedia
    means little to us. We want them protected-"

    He was shouted down.

    "The Encyclopedia first," ground out Crast. "We have a mission to fulfill."

    "Mission, hell," shouted Hardin. "That might have been true fifty years ago. But this is a new
    generation."

    "That has nothing to do with it," replied Pirenne. "We are scientists."

    And Hardin leaped through the opening. "Are you, though? That's a nice hallucination, isn't it?
    Your bunch here is a perfect example of what's been wrong with the entire Galaxy for
    thousands of years. What kind of science is it to be stuck out here for centuries classifying the
    work of scientists of the last millennium? Have you ever thought of working onward, extending
    their knowledge and improving upon it? No! You're quite happy to stagnate. The whole Galaxy
    is, and has been for space knows how long. That's why the Periphery is revolting; that's why
    communications are breaking down; that's why petty wars are becoming eternal; that's why
    whole systems are losing nuclear power and going back to barbarous techniques of chemical
    power.



    If you ask me," he cried, "the Galactic Empire is dying!"


    He paused and dropped into his chair to catch his breath, paying no attention to the two or
    three that were attempting simultaneously to answer him.

    Crast got the floor. "I don't know what you're trying to gain by your hysterical statements, Mr.
    Mayor. Certainly, you are adding nothing constructive to the discussion. I move, Mr. Chairman,
    that the speaker's remarks be placed out of order and the discussion be resumed from the point
    where it was interrupted."

    Jord Fara bestirred himself for the first time. Up to this point Fara had taken no part in the
    argument even at its hottest. But now his ponderous voice, every bit as ponderous as his
    three-hundred-pound body, burst its bass way out.

    "Haven't we forgotten something, gentlemen?"

    "What?" asked Pirenne, peevishly.

    "That in a month we celebrate our fiftieth anniversary." Fara had a trick of uttering the most
    obvious platitudes with great profundity.

    "What of it?"

    "And on that anniversary," continued Fara, placidly, "Hari Seldon's Vault will open. Have you
    ever considered what might be in the Vault?"

    "I don't know. Routine matters. A stock Speech of congratulations, perhaps. I don't think any
    significance need be placed on the Vault - though the Journal'- and he glared at Hardin, who
    grinned back -"did try to make an issue of it. I put a stop to that."

    "Ah," said Fara, "but perhaps you are wrong. Doesn't it strike you" - he paused and put a finger
    to his round little nose -"that the Vault is opening at a very convenient time?"

    "Very inconvenient time, you mean," muttered Fulham. "We've got some other things to worry
    about."

    "Other things more important than a message from Hari Seldon? I think not." Fara was growing
    more pontifical than ever, and Hardin eyed him thoughtfully. What was he getting at?

    "In fact," said Fara, happily, "you all seem to forget that Seldon was the greatest psychologist of
    our time and that he was the founder of our Foundation. It seems reasonable to assume that he
    used his science to determine the probable course of the history of the immediate future. If he
    did, as seems likely, I repeat, he would certainly have managed to find a way to warn us of
    danger and, perhaps, to point out a solution. The Encyclopedia was very dear to his heart, you
    know."

    An aura of puzzled doubt prevailed. Pirenne hemmed. "Well, now, I don't know. Psychology is a
    great science, but-there are no psychologists among us at the moment, I believe. It seems to
    me we're on uncertain ground."

    Fara turned to Hardin. "Didn't you study psychology under Alurin?"



    Hardin answered, half in reverie: "Yes, I never completed my studies, though. I got tired of
    theory. I wanted to be a psychological engineer, but we lacked the facilities, so I did the next
    best thing - I went into politics. It's practically the same thing."

    "Well, what do you think of the Vault?"

    And Hardin replied cautiously, "I don't know."

    He did not say a word for the remainder of the meeting even though it got back to the subject of
    the Chancellor of the Empire.

    In fact, he didn't even listen. He'd been put on a new track and things were falling into
    place-just a little. Little angles were fitting together - one or two.

    And psychology was the key. He was sure of that.

    He was trying desperately to remember the psychological theory he had once learned - and
    from it he got one thing right at the start.

    A great psychologist such as Seldon could unravel human emotions and human reactions
    sufficiently to be able to predict broadly the historical sweep of the future.

    And what would that mean?


    4 .

    Lord Dorwin took snuff. He also had long hair, curled intricately and, quite obviously, artificially,
    to which were added a pair of fluffy, blond sideburns, which he fondled affectionately. Then,
    too, he spoke in overprecise statements and left out all the r's.

    At the moment, Hardin had no time to think of more of the reasons for the instant detestation in
    which he had held the noble chancellor. Oh, yes, the elegant gestures of one hand with which
    he accompanied his remarks and the studied condescension with which he accompanied even
    a simple affirmative.

    But, at any rate, the problem now was to locate him. He had disappeared with Pirenne half an
    hour before - passed clean out of sight, blast him.

    Hardin was quite sure that his own absence during the preliminary discussions would quite suit
    Pirenne.

    But Pirenne had been seen in this wing And on this floor. It was simply a matter of trying every
    door. Halfway down, he said, "Ah!" and stepped into the darkened room. The profile of Lord
    Dorwin's intricate hair-do was unmistakable against the lighted screen.

    Lord Dorwin looked up and said: "Ah, Hahdin. You ah looking foah us, no doubt?" He held out
    his snuffbox - overadorned and poor workmanship at that, noted Hardinand was politely
    refused whereat he helped himself to a pinch and smiled graciously.



    Pirenne scowled and Hardin met that with an expression of blank indifference.

    The only sound to break the short silence that followed was the clicking of the lid of Lord
    Dorwin's snuffbox. And then he put it away and said:

    "A gweat achievement, this Encyclopedia of yoahs, Hahdin. A feat, indeed, to rank with the
    most majestic accomplishments of all time."

    "Most of us think so, milord. It's an accomplishment not quite accomplished as yet, however."

    "Fwom the little I have seen of the efficiency of yoah Foundation, I have no feahs on that
    scoah." And he nodded to Pirenne, who responded with a delighted bow.

    Quite a love feast, thought Hardin. "I wasn't complaining about the lack of efficiency, milord, as
    much as of the definite excess of efficiency on the part of the Anacreonians - though in another
    and more destructive direction."

    "Ah, yes, Anacweon." A negligent wave of the hand. "I have just come from theah. Most
    bahbawous planet. It is thowoughly inconceivable that human beings could live heah in the
    Pewiphewy. The lack of the most elementawy wequiahments of a cultuahed gentleman; the
    absence of the most fundamental necessities foah comfoht and convenience - the uttah
    desuetude into which they-"

    Hardin interrupted dryly: "The Anacreonians, unfortunately, have all the elementary
    requirements for warfare and all the fundamental necessities for destruction."

    "Quite, quite." Lord Dorwin seemed annoyed, perhaps at being stopped midway in his
    sentence. "But we ahn't to discuss business now, y'know. Weally, I'm othahwise concuhned.
    Doctah Piwenne, ahn't you going to show me the second volume? Do, please."

    The lights clicked out and for the next half-hour Hardin might as well have been on Anacreon
    for all the attention they paid him. The book upon the screen made little sense to him, nor did
    he trouble to make the attempt to follow, but Lord Dorwin became quite humanly excited at
    times. Hardin noticed that during these moments of excitement the chancellor pronounced his
    r's.

    When the lights went on again, Lord Dorwin said: "Mahvelous. Twuly mahvelous. You ah not,
    by chance, intewested in ahchaeology, ah you, Hahdin?"

    "Eh?" Hardin shook himself out of an abstracted reverie. "No, milord, can't say I am. I'm a
    psychologist by original intention and a politician by final decision."

    "Ah! No doubt intewesting studies. 1 , myself, y'know" - he helped himself to a giant pinch of
    snuff -"dabble in ahchaeology."

    "Indeed?"

    "His lordship," interrupted Pirenne, "is most thoroughly acquainted with the field."

    "Well, p'haps I am, p'haps I am," said his lordship complacently. "I have done an awful amount
    of wuhk in the science. Extwemely well-read, in fact. I've gone thwough all of Jawdun, Obijasi,



    Kwomwill ... oh, all of them, y'know."

    "I've heard of them, of course," said Hardin, "but I've never read them."

    "You should some day, my deah fellow. It would amply repay you. Why, I cutainly considah it
    well wuhth the twip heah to the Pewiphewy to see this copy of Lameth. Would you believe it,
    my Libwawy totally lacks a copy. By the way, Doctah Piwenne, you have not fohgotten yoah
    pwomise to twansdevelop a copy foah me befoah I leave?"

    "Only too pleased."

    "Lameth, you must know," continued the chancellor, politically, "pwesents a new and most
    intwesting addition to my pwevious knowledge of the 'Owigin Question.'"

    "Which question?" asked Hardin.

    "The 'Owigin Question.' The place of the owigin of the human species, y'know. Suahly you must
    know that it is thought that owiginally the human wace occupied only one planetawy system."

    "Well, yes, I know that."

    "Of cohse, no one knows exactly which system it is - lost in the mists of antiquity. Theah ah
    theawies, howevah. Siwius, some say. Othahs insist on Alpha Centauwi, oah on Sol, oah on 61
    Cygni - all in the Siwius sectah, you see."

    "And what does Lameth say?"

    "Well, he goes off along a new twail completely. He twies to show that ahchaeological wemains
    on the thuhd planet of the Ahctuwian System show that humanity existed theah befoah theah
    wah any indications of space-twavel."

    "And that means it was humanity's birth planet?"

    "P'haps. I must wead it closely and weigh the evidence befoah I can say foah cuhtain. One
    must see just how weliable his obsuhvations ah."

    Hardin remained silent for a short while. Then he said, "When did Lameth write his book?"

    "Oh - I should say about eight hundwed yeahs ago. Of cohse, he has based it lahgely on the
    pwevious wuhk of Gleen."

    "Then why rely on him? Why not go to Arcturus and study the remains for yourself?"

    Lord Dorwin raised his eyebrows and took a pinch of snuff hurriedly. "Why, whatevah foah, my
    deah fellow?"

    "To get the information firsthand, of course."

    "But wheah's the necessity? It seems an uncommonly woundabout and hopelessly
    wigmawolish method of getting anywheahs. Look heah, now, I've got the wuhks of all the old
    mastahs - the gweat ahchaeologists of the past. I wigh them against each othah - balance the
    disagweements - analyze the conflicting statements - decide which is pwobably cowwect -



    and come to a conclusion. That is the scientific method. At least" - patronizingly -"as / see it.
    How insuffewably cwude it would be to go to Ahctuwus, oah to Sol, foah instance, and blundah
    about, when the old mastahs have covahed the gwound so much moah effectually than we
    could possibly hope to do."

    Hardin murmured politely, "I see."

    "Come, milord," said Pirenne, "think we had better be returning."

    "Ah, yes. P'haps we had."

    As they left the room, Hardin said suddenly, "Milord, may I ask a question?"

    Lord Dorwin smiled blandly and emphasized his answer with a gracious flutter of the hand.
    "Cuhtainly, my deah fellow. Only too happy to be of suhvice. If I can help you in any way fwom
    my pooah stoah of knowledge-"

    "It isn't exactly about archaeology, milord."

    "No?"

    "No. It's this: Last year we received news here in Terminus about the meltdown of a power
    plant on Planet V of Gamma Andromeda. We got the barest outline of the accident - no details
    at all. I wonder if you could tell me exactly what happened."

    Pirenne's mouth twisted. "I wonder you annoy his lordship with questions on totally irrelevant
    subjects."

    "Not at all, Doctah Piwenne," interceded the chancellor. "It is quite all wight. Theah isn't much to
    say concuhning it in any case. The powah plant did undergo meltdown and it was quite a
    catastwophe, y'know. I believe wadiatsen damage. Weally, the govuhnment is sewiously
    considewing placing seveah westwictions upon the indiscwiminate use of nucleah powah -
    though that is not a thing for genewal publication, y'know."

    "I understand," said Hardin. "But what was wrong with the plant?"

    "Well, weally," replied Lord Dorwin indifferently, "who knows? It had bwoken down some yeahs
    pweviously and it is thought that the weplacements and wepaiah wuhk wuh most infewiah. It is
    so difficult these days to find men who weally undahstand the moah technical details of ouah
    powah systems." And he took a sorrowful pinch of snuff.

    "You realize," said Hardin, "that the independent kingdoms of the Periphery had lost nuclear
    power altogether?"

    "Have they? I'm not at all suhpwised. Bahbawous planets- Oh, but my deah fellow, don't call
    them independent. They ahn't, y'know. The tweaties we've made with them ah pwoof positive of
    that. They acknowledge the soveweignty of the Empewah. They'd have to, of cohse, oah we
    wouldn't tweat with them."


    That may be so, but they have considerable freedom of action.



    "Yes, I suppose so. Considewable. But that scahcely mattahs. The Empiah is fah bettah off,
    with the Pewiphewy thwown upon its own wesoahces - as it is, moah oah less. They ahn't any
    good to us, y'know. Most bahbawous planets. Scahcely civilized."

    "They were civilized in the past. Anacreon was one of the richest of the outlying provinces. I
    understand it compared favorably with Vega itself."

    "Oh, but, Hahdin, that was centuwies ago. You can scahcely dwaw conclusion fwom that.
    Things wah diffewent in the old gweat days. We ahn't the men we used to be, y'know. But,
    Hahdin, come, you ah a most puhsistent chap.

    I've told you I simply won't discuss business today. Doctah Piwenne did pwepayah me foah
    you. He told me you would twy to badgah me, but I'm fah too old a hand foah that. Leave it foah
    next day. And that was that.


    5 .

    This was the second meeting of the Board that Hardin had attended, if one were to exclude the
    informal talks the Board members had had with the now-departed Lord Dorwin. Yet the mayor
    had a perfectly definite idea that at least one other, and possibly two or three, had been held, to
    which he had somehow never received an invitation.

    Nor, it seemed to him, would he have received notification of this one had it not been for the
    ultimatum.

    At least, it amounted to an ultimatum, though a superficial reading of the visigraphed document
    would lead one to suppose that it was a friendly interchange of greetings between two
    potentates.

    Hardin fingered it gingerly. It started off floridly with a salutation from "His Puissant Majesty, the
    King of Anacreon, to his friend and brother, Dr. Lewis Pirenne, Chairman of the Board of
    Trustees, of the Encyclopedia Foundation Number One," and it ended even more lavishly with
    a gigantic, multicolored seal of the most involved symbolism.

    But it was an ultimatum just the same.

    Hardin said: "It turned out that we didn't have much time after all - only three months. But little
    as it was, we threw it away unused. This thing here gives us a week. What do we do now?"

    Pirenne frowned worriedly. "There must be a loophole. It is absolutely unbelievable that they
    would push matters to extremities in the face of what Lord Dorwin has assured us regarding the
    attitude of the Emperor and the Empire."

    Hardin perked up. "I see. You have informed the King of Anacreon of this alleged attitude?"

    "I did - after having placed the proposal to the Board for a vote and having received unanimous
    consent."


    And when did this vote take place?



    Pirenne climbed onto his dignity. "I do not believe I am answerable to you in any way, Mayor
    Hardin."


    "All right. I'm not that vitally interested. It's just my opinion that it was your diplomatic
    transmission of Lord Dorwin's valuable contribution to the situation"- he lifted the comer of his
    mouth in a sour half-smile -"that was the direct cause of this friendly little note. They might
    have delayed longer otherwise - though I don't think the additional time would have helped
    Terminus any, considering the attitude of the Board."

    Said Yate Fulham: "And just how do you arrive at that remarkable conclusion, Mr. Mayor?"

    "In a rather simple way. It merely required the use of that much-neglected commodity -
    common sense. You see, there is a branch of human knowledge known as symbolic logic,
    which can be used to prune away all sorts of clogging deadwood that clutters up human
    language."

    "What about it?" said Fulham.

    "I applied it. Among other things, I applied it to this document here. I didn't really need to for
    myself because I knew what it was all about, but I think I can explain it more easily to five
    physical scientists by symbols rather than by words."

    Hardin removed a few sheets of paper from the pad under his arm and spread them out. "I
    didn't do this myself, by the way," he said. "Muller Hoik of the Division of Logic has his name
    signed to the analyses, as you can see."

    Pirenne leaned over the table to get a better view and Hardin continued: "The message from
    Anacreon was a simple problem, naturally, for the men who wrote it were men of action rather
    than men of words. It boils down easily and straightforwardly to the unqualified statement, when
    in symbols is what you see, and which in words, roughly translated, is, 'You give us what we
    want in a week, or we take it by force.'"

    There was silence as the five members of the Board ran down the line of symbols, and then
    Pirenne sat down and coughed uneasily.

    Hardin said, "No loophole, is there, Dr. Pirenne?"

    "Doesn't seem to be."

    "All right." Hardin replaced the sheets. "Before you now you see a copy of the treaty between
    the Empire and Anacreon - a treaty, incidentally, which is signed on the Emperor's behalf by
    the same Lord Dorwin who was here last week - and with it a symbolic analysis."

    The treaty ran through five pages of fine print and the analysis was scrawled out in just under
    half a page.

    "As you see, gentlemen, something like ninety percent of the treaty boiled right out of the
    analysis as being meaningless, and what we end up with can be described in the following
    interesting manner:

    "Obligations of Anacreon to the Empire: None!



    Powers of the Empire over Anacreon: None!"


    Again the five followed the reasoning anxiously, checking carefully back to the treaty, and when
    they were finished, Pirenne said in a worried fashion, "That seems to be correct."

    "You admit, then, that the treaty is nothing but a declaration of total independence on the part of
    Anacreon and a recognition of that status by the Empire?"

    "It seems so."

    "And do you suppose that Anacreon doesn't realize that, and is not anxious to emphasize the
    position of independence - so that it would naturally tend to resent any appearance of threats
    from the Empire? Particularly when it is evident that the Empire is powerless to fulfill any such
    threats, or it would never have allowed independence."

    "But then," interposed Sutt, "how would Mayor Hardin account for Lord Dorwin's assurances of
    Empire support? They seemed He shrugged. "Well, they seemed satisfactory."

    Hardin threw himself back in the chair. "You know, that's the most interesting part of the whole
    business. I'll admit I had thought his Lordship a most consummate donkey when I first met him
    - but it turned out that he was actually an accomplished diplomat and a most clever man. I took
    the liberty of recording all his statements."

    There was a flurry, and Pirenne opened his mouth in horror.

    "What of it?" demanded Hardin. "I realize it was a gross breach of hospitality and a thing no
    so-called gentleman would do. Also, that if his lordship had caught on, things might have been
    unpleasant; but he didn't, and I have the record, and that's that. I took that record, had it copied
    out and sent that to Hoik for analysis, also."

    Lundin Crast said, "And where is the analysis?"

    "That," replied Hardin, "is the interesting thing. The analysis was the most difficult of the three
    by all odds. When Hoik, after two days of steady work, succeeded in eliminating meaningless
    statements, vague gibberish, useless qualifications - in short, all the goo and dribble - he
    found he had nothing left. Everything canceled out."

    "Lord Dorwin, gentlemen, in five days of discussion didn't say one damned thing, and said it so
    you never noticed. There are the assurances you had from your precious Empire."

    Hardin might have placed an actively working stench bomb on the table and created no more
    confusion than existed after his last statement. He waited, with weary patience, for it to die
    down.

    "So," he concluded, "when you sent threats - and that's what they were - concerning Empire
    action to Anacreon, you merely irritated a monarch who knew better. Naturally, his ego would
    demand immediate action, and the ultimatum is the result-which brings me to my original
    statement. We have one week left and what do we do now?"

    "It seems," said Sutt, "that we have no choice but to allow Anacreon to establish military bases



    on Terminus.


    "I agree with you there," replied Hardin, "but what do we do toward kicking them off again at the
    first opportunity?"

    Yate Fulham's mustache twitched. "That sounds as if you have made up your mind that
    violence must be used against them."

    "Violence," came the retort, "is the last refuge of the incompetent. But I certainly don't intend to
    lay down the welcome mat and brush off the best furniture for their use."

    "I still don't like the way you put that," insisted Fulham. "It is a dangerous attitude; the more
    dangerous because we have noticed lately that a sizable section of the populace seems to
    respond to all your suggestions just so. I might as well tell you, Mayor Hardin, that the board is
    not quite blind to your recent activities."

    He paused and there was general agreement. Hardin shrugged.

    Fulham went on: "If you were to inflame the City into an act of violence, you would achieve
    elaborate suicide - and we don't intend to allow that. Our policy has but one cardinal principle,
    and that is the Encyclopedia. Whatever we decide to do or not to do will be so decided because
    it will be the measure required to keep that Encyclopedia safe."

    "Then," said Hardin, "you come to the conclusion that we must continue our intensive campaign
    of doing nothing."

    Pirenne said bitterly: "You have yourself demonstrated that the Empire cannot help us; though
    how and why it can be so, I don't understand. If compromise is necessary-"

    Hardin had the nightmarelike sensation of running at top speed and getting nowhere. "There is
    no compromise! Don't you realize that this bosh about military bases is a particularly inferior
    grade of drivel? Haut Rodric told us what Anacreon was after - outright annexation and
    imposition of its own feudal system of landed estates and peasant-aristocracy economy upon
    us. What is left of our bluff of nuclear power may force them to move slowly, but they will move
    nonetheless."

    He had risen indignantly, and the rest rose with him except for Jord Fara.

    And then Jord Fara spoke. "Everyone will please sit down. We've gone quite far enough, I
    think. Come, there's no use looking so furious, Mayor Hardin; none of us have been committing
    treason."

    "You'll have to convince me of that!"

    Fara smiled gently. "You know you don't mean that. Let me speak!"


    His little shrewd eyes were half closed, and the perspiration gleamed on the smooth expanse of
    his chin. "There seems no point in concealing that the Board has come to the decision that the
    real solution to the Anacreonian problem lies in what is to be revealed to us when the Vault



    opens six days from now.


    "Is that your contribution to the matter?"

    "Yes."

    "We are to do nothing, is that fight, except to wait in quiet serenity and utter faith for the deus ex
    machina to pop out of the Vault?"

    "Stripped of your emotional phraseology, that's the idea."

    "Such unsubtle escapism! Really, Dr. Fara, such folly smacks of genius. A lesser mind would
    be incapable of it."

    Fara smiled indulgently. "Your taste in epigrams is amusing, Hardin, but out of place. As a
    matter of fact, I think you remember my line of argument concerning the Vault about three
    weeks ago."

    "Yes, I remember it. I don't deny that it was anything but a stupid idea from the standpoint of
    deductive logic alone. You said - stop me when I make a mistake - that Hari Seldon was the
    greatest psychologist in the System; that, hence, he could foresee the right and uncomfortable
    spot we're in now; that, hence, he established the Vault as a method of telling us the way out."

    "You've got the essence of the idea."

    "Would it surprise you to hear that I've given considerable thought to the matter these last
    weeks?"

    "Very flattering. With what result?"

    "With the result that pure deduction is found wanting. Again what is needed is a little sprinkling
    of common sense."

    "For instance?"

    "For instance, if he foresaw the Anacreonian mess, why not have placed us on some other
    planet nearer the Galactic centers? It's well known that Seldon maneuvered the Commissioners
    on Trantor into ordering the Foundation established on Terminus. But why should he have done
    so? Why put us out here at all if he could see in advance the break in communication lines, our
    isolation from the Galaxy, the threat of our neighbors - and our helplessness because of the
    lack of metals on Terminus? That above all! Or if he foresaw all this, why not have warned the
    original settlers in advance that they might have had time to prepare, rather than wait, as he is
    doing, until one foot is over the cliff, before doing so?

    "And don't forget this. Even though he could foresee the problem then, we can see it equally
    well now. Therefore, if he could foresee the solution then, we should be able to see it now. After
    all, Seldon was not a magician. There are no trick methods of escaping from a dilemma that he
    can see and we can't."



    But, Hardin," reminded Fara, "we can't!


    "But you haven't tried. You haven't tried once. First, you refused to admit that there was a
    menace at all! Then you reposed an absolutely blind faith in the Emperor! Now you've shifted it
    to Hari Seldon. Throughout you have invariably relied on authority or on the past - never on
    yourselves."

    His fists balled spasmodically. "It amounts to a diseased attitude - a conditioned reflex that
    shunts aside the independence of your minds whenever it is a question of opposing authority.
    There seems no doubt ever in your minds that the Emperor is more powerful than you are, or
    Hari Seldon wiser. And that's wrong, don't you see?"

    For some reason, no one cared to answer him.

    Hardin continued: "It isn't just you. It's the whole Galaxy. Pirenne heard Lord Dorwin's idea of
    scientific research. Lord Dorwin thought the way to be a good archaeologist was to read all the
    books on the subject - written by men who were dead for centuries. He thought that the way to
    solve archaeological puzzles was to weigh the opposing authorities. And Pirenne listened and
    made no objections. Don't you see that there's something wrong with that?"

    Again the note of near-pleading in his voice. Again no answer.

    He went on: "And you men and half of Terminus as well are just as bad. We sit here,
    considering the Encyclopedia the all-in-all. We consider the greatest end of science, is the
    classification of past data. It is important, but is there no further work to be done? We're
    receding and forgetting, don't you see? Here in the Periphery they've lost nuclear power. In
    Gamma Andromeda, a power plant has undergone meltdown because of poor repairs, and the
    Chancellor of the Empire complains that nuclear technicians are scarce. And the solution? To
    train new ones? Never! Instead they're to restrict nuclear power."

    And for the third time: "Don't you see? It's Galaxywide. It's a worship of the past. It's a
    deterioration - a stagnation!"

    He stared from one to the other and they gazed fixedly at him.

    Fara was the first to recover. "Well, mystical philosophy isn't going to help us here. Let us be
    concrete. Do you deny that Hari Seldon could easily have worked out historical trends of the
    future by simple psychological technique?"

    "No, of course not," cried Hardin. "But we can't rely on him for a solution. At best, he might
    indicate the problem, but if ever there is to be a solution, we must work it out ourselves. He
    can't do it for us."

    Fulham spoke suddenly. "What do you mean - 'indicate the problem'? We know the problem."

    Hardin whirled on him. "You think you do? You think Anacreon is all Hari Seldon is likely to be
    worried about. I disagree! I tell you, gentlemen, that as yet none of you has the faintest
    conception of what is really going on."

    "And you do?" questioned Pirenne, hostilely.



    "I think so!" Hardin jumped up and pushed his chair away. His eyes were cold and hard. "If
    there's one thing that's definite, it is that there's something smelly about the whole situation;
    something that is bigger than anything we've talked about yet. Just ask yourself this question:
    Why was it that among the original population of the Foundation not one first-class psychologist
    was included, except Bor Alurin? And he carefully refrained from training his pupils in more
    than the fundamentals."

    A short silence and Fara said: "All right. Why?"

    "Perhaps because a psychologist might have caught on to what this was all about - and too
    soon to suit Hari Seldon. As it is, we've been stumbling about, getting misty glimpses of the
    truth and no more. And that is what Hari Seldon wanted."

    He laughed harshly. "Good day, gentlemen!"

    He stalked out of the room.


    6 .

    Mayor Hardin chewed at the end of his cigar. It had gone out but he was past noticing that. He
    hadn't slept the night before and he had a good idea that he wouldn't sleep this coming night.
    His eyes showed it.

    He said wearily, "And that covers it?"

    "I think so." Yohan Lee put a hand to his chin. "How does it sound?"

    "Not too bad. It's got to be done, you understand, with impudence. That is, there is to be no
    hesitation; no time to allow them to grasp the situation. Once we are in a position to give
    orders, why, give them as though you were born to do so, and they'll obey out of habit. That's
    the essence of a coup."

    "If the Board remains irresolute for even

    "The Board? Count them out. After tomorrow, their importance as a factor in Terminus affairs
    won't matter a rusty half-credit."

    Lee nodded slowly. "Yet it is strange that they've done nothing to stop us so far. You say they
    weren't entirely in the dark."

    "Fara stumbles at the edges of the problem. Sometimes he makes me nervous. And Pirenne's
    been suspicious of me since I was elected. But, you see, they never had the capacity of really
    understanding what was up. Their whole training has been authoritarian. They are sure that the
    Emperor, just because he is the Emperor, is all-powerful. And they are sure that the Board of
    Trustees, simply because it is the Board of Trustees acting in the name of the Emperor, cannot
    be in a position where it does not give the orders. That incapacity to recognize the possibility of
    revolt is our best ally."

    He heaved out of his chair and went to the water cooler. "They're not bad fellows, Lee, when



    they stick to their Encyclopedia - and we'll see that that's where they stick in the future. They're
    hopelessly incompetent when it comes to ruling Terminus. Go away now and start things
    rolling. I want to be alone."

    He sat down on the comer of his desk and stared at the cup of water.

    Space! If only he were as confident as he pretended! The Anacreonians were landing in two
    days and what had he to go on but a set of notions and half-guesses as to what Had Seldon
    had been driving at these past fifty years? He wasn't even a real, honest-to-goodness
    psychologist - just a tumbler with a little training trying to outguess the greatest mind of the
    age.

    If Fara were fight; if Anacreon were all the problem Hari Seldon had foreseen; if the
    Encyclopedia were all he was interested in preserving - then what price coup d'etat?

    He shrugged and drank his water.


    7 .

    The Vault was furnished with considerably more than six chairs, as though a larger company
    had been expected. Hardin noted that thoughtfully and seated himself wearily in a comer just
    as far from the other five as possible.

    The Board members did not seem to object to that arrangement. They spoke among
    themselves in whispers, which fell off into sibilant monosyllables, and then into nothing at all. Of
    them all, only Jord Fara seemed even reasonably calm. He had produced a watch and was
    staring at it somberly.

    Hardin glanced at his own watch and then at the glass cubicle - absolutely empty - that
    dominated half the room. It was the only unusual feature of the room, for aside from that there
    was no indication that somewhere a computer was splitting off instants of time toward that
    precise moment when a muon stream would flow, a connection be made and-

    The lights went dim!

    They didn't go out, but merely yellowed and sank with a suddenness that made Hardin jump.

    He had lifted his eyes to the ceiling lights in startled fashion, and when he brought them down
    the glass cubicle was no longer empty.

    A figure occupied it , a figure in a wheel chair!

    It said nothing for a few moments, but it closed the book upon its lap and fingered it idly. And
    then it smiled, and the face seemed all alive.

    It said, "I am Hari Seldon." The voice was old and soft.

    Hardin almost rose to acknowledge the introduction and stopped himself in the act.

    The voice continued conversationally: "As you see, I am confined to this chair and cannot rise



    to greet you. Your grandparents left for Terminus a few months back in my time and since then
    I have suffered a rather inconvenient paralysis. I can't see you, you know, so I can't greet you
    properly. I don't even know how many of you there are, so all this must be conducted
    informally. If any of you are standing, please sit down; and if you care to smoke, I wouldn't
    mind." There was a light chuckle. "Why should I? I'm not really here."

    Hardin fumbled for a cigar almost automatically, but thought better of it.

    Hari Seldon put away his book - as if laying it upon a desk at his side - and when his fingers let
    go, it disappeared.

    He said: "It is fifty years now since this Foundation was established - fifty years in which the
    members of the Foundation have been ignorant of what it was they were working toward. It was
    necessary that they be ignorant, but now the necessity is gone.

    "The Encyclopedia Foundation, to begin with, is a fraud, and always has been!"

    There was a sound of a scramble behind Hardin and one or two muffled exclamations, but he
    did not turn around.

    Hari Seldon was, of course, undisturbed. He went on: "It is a fraud in the sense that neither I
    nor my colleagues care at all whether a single volume of the Encyclopedia is ever published. It
    has served its purpose, since by it we extracted an imperial charter from the Emperor, by it we
    attracted the hundred thousand humans necessary for our scheme, and by it we managed to
    keep them preoccupied while events shaped themselves, until it was too late for any of them to
    draw back.

    "In the fifty years that you have worked on this fraudulent project - there is no use in softening
    phrases - your retreat has been cut off, and you have now no choice but to proceed on the
    infinitely more important project that was, and is, our real plan.

    "To that end we have placed you on such a planet and at such a time that in fifty years you
    were maneuvered to the point where you no longer have freedom of action. From now on, and
    into the centuries, the path you must take is inevitable. You will be faced with a series of crises,
    as you are now faced with the first, and in each case your freedom of action will become
    similarly circumscribed so that you will be forced along one, and only one, path.

    "It is that path which our psychology has worked out - and for a reason.

    "For centuries Galactic civilization has stagnated and declined, though only a few ever realized
    that. But now, at last, the Periphery is breaking away and the political unity of the Empire is
    shattered. Somewhere in the fifty years just past is where the historians of the future will place
    an arbitrary line and say: 'This marks the Fall of the Galactic Empire.'

    "And they will be right, though scarcely any will recognize that Fall for additional centuries.

    "And after the Fall will come inevitable barbarism, a period which, our psychohistory tells us,
    should, under ordinary circumstances, last for thirty thousand years. We cannot stop the Fall.
    We do not wish to; for Imperial culture has lost whatever virility and worth it once had. But we
    can shorten the period of Barbarism that must follow - down to a single thousand of years.



    "The ins and outs of that shortening, we cannot tell you; just as we could not tell you the truth
    about the Foundation fifty years ago. Were you to discover those ins and outs, our plan might
    fail; as it would have, had you penetrated the fraud of the Encyclopedia earlier; for then, by
    knowledge, your freedom of action would be expanded and the number of additional variables
    introduced would become greater than our psychology could handle.

    "But you won't, for there are no psychologists on Terminus, and never were, but for Alurin -
    and he was one of us.

    "But this I can tell you: Terminus and its companion Foundation at the other end of the Galaxy
    are the seeds of the Renascence and the future founders of the Second Galactic Empire. And it
    is the present crisis that is starting Terminus off to that climax.

    "This, by the way, is a rather straightforward crisis, much simpler than many of those that are
    ahead. To reduce it to its fundamentals, it is this: You are a planet suddenly cut off from the
    still-civilized centers of the Galaxy, and threatened by your stronger neighbors. You are a small
    world of scientists surrounded by vast and rapidly expanding reaches of barbarism. You are an
    island of nuclear power in a growing ocean of more primitive energy; but are helpless despite
    that, because of your lack of metals.

    "You see, then, that you are faced by hard necessity, and that action is forced on you. The
    nature of that action - that is, the solution to your dilemma - is, of course, obvious!"

    The image of Hari Seldon reached into open air and the book once more appeared in his hand.
    Fie opened it and said:

    "But whatever devious course your future history may take, impress it always upon your
    descendants that the path has been marked out, and that at its end is new and greater Empire!"

    And as his eyes bent to his book, he flicked into nothingness, and the lights brightened once
    more.

    Hardin looked up to see Pirenne facing him, eyes tragic and lips trembling.

    The chairman's voice was firm but toneless. "You were right, it seems. If you will see us tonight
    at six, the Board will consult with you as to the next move."

    They shook his hand, each one, and left, and Hardin smiled to himself. They were
    fundamentally sound at that; for they were scientists enough to admit that they were wrong -
    but for them, it was too late.

    Fie looked at his watch. By this time, it was all over. Lee's men were in control and the Board
    was giving orders no longer.

    The Anacreonians were landing their first spaceships tomorrow, but that was all right, too. In six
    months, they would be giving orders no longer.

    In fact, as Hari Seldon had said, and as Salvor Hardin had guessed since the day that Anselm
    haut Rodric had first revealed to him Anacreon's lack of nuclear power - the solution to this first
    crisis was obvious.



    Obvious as all hell!


    PART III

    THE MAYORS

    i.

    THE FOUR KINGDOMS - The name given to those portions of the Province of Anacreon which
    broke away from the First Empire in the early years of the Foundational Era to form
    independent and short-lived kingdoms. The largest and most powerful of these was Anacreon
    itself which in area...

    ... Undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of the history of the Four Kingdoms involves the
    strange society forced temporarily upon it during the administration of Salvor Hardin....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    A deputation!

    That Salvor Hardin had seen it coming made it none the more pleasant. On the contrary, he
    found anticipation distinctly annoying.

    Yohan Lee advocated extreme measures. "I don't see, Hardin," he said, "that we need waste
    any time. They can't do anything till next election - legally, anyway - and that gives us a year.
    Give them the brush-off."

    Hardin pursed his lips. "Lee, you'll never learn. In the forty years I've known you, you've never
    once learned the gentle art of sneaking up from behind."

    "It's not my way of fighting," grumbled Lee.

    "Yes, I know that. I suppose that's why you're the one man I trust." He paused and reached for
    a cigar. "We've come a long way, Lee, since we engineered our coup against the
    Encyclopedists way back. I'm getting old. Sixty-two. Do you ever think how fast those thirty
    years went?"

    Lee snorted. "I don't feel old, and I'm sixty-six."

    "Yes, but I haven't your digestion." Hardin sucked lazily at his cigar. He had long since stopped
    wishing for the mild Vegan tobacco of his youth. Those days when the planet, Terminus, had
    trafficked with every part of the Galactic Empire belonged in the limbo to which all Good Old
    Days go. Toward the same limbo where the Galactic Empire was heading. He wondered who
    the new emperor was - or if there was a new emperor at all - or any Empire. Space! For thirty
    years now, since the breakup of communications here at the edge of the Galaxy, the whole
    universe of Terminus had consisted of itself and the four surrounding kingdoms.




    How the mighty had fallen! Kingdoms ! They were prefects in the old days, all part of the same
    province, which in turn had been part of a sector, which in turn had been part of a quadrant,
    which in turn had been part of the allembracing Galactic Empire. And now that the Empire had
    lost control over the farther reaches of the Galaxy, these little splinter groups of planets became
    kingdoms - with comic-opera kings and nobles, and petty, meaningless wars, and a life that
    went on pathetically among the ruins.

    A civilization falling. Nuclear power forgotten. Science fading to mythology - until the
    Foundation had stepped in. The Foundation that Hari Seldon had established for just that
    purpose here on Terminus.

    Lee was at the window and his voice broke in on Hardin's reverie. "They've come," he said, "in
    a late-model ground car, the young pups." He took a few uncertain steps toward the door and
    then looked at Hardin.

    Hardin smiled, and waved him back. "I've given orders to have them brought up here."

    "Here! What for? You're making them too important."

    "Why go through all the ceremonies of an official mayor's audience? I'm getting too old for red
    tape. Besides which, flattery is useful when dealing with youngsters - particularly when it
    doesn't commit you to anything." He winked. "Sit down, Lee, and give me your moral backing.

    I'll need it with this young Sermak."

    "That fellow, Sermak," said Lee, heavily, "is dangerous. He's got a following, Hardin, so don't
    underestimate him."

    "Have I ever underestimated anybody?"

    "Well, then, arrest him. You can accuse him of something or other afterward."

    Hardin ignored that last bit of advice. "There they are, Lee." In response to the signal, he
    stepped on the pedal beneath his desk, and the door slid aside.

    They filed in, the four that composed the deputation, and Hardin waved them gently to the
    armchairs that faced his desk in a semicircle. They bowed and waited for the mayor to speak
    first.

    Hardin flicked open the curiously carved silver lid of the cigar box that had once belonged to
    Jord Fara of the old Board of Trustees in the long-dead days of the Encyclopedists. It was a
    genuine Empire product from Santanni, though the cigars it now contained were home-grown.
    One by one, with grave solemnity, the four of the deputation accepted cigars and lit up in
    ritualistic fashion.

    Sef Sermak was second from the right, the youngest of the young group - and the most
    interesting with his bristly yellow mustache trimmed precisely, and his sunken eyes of uncertain
    color. The other three Hardin dismissed almost immediately; they were rank and file on the face
    of them. It was on Sermak that he concentrated, the Sermak who had already, in his first term
    in the City Council, turned that sedate body topsy-turvy more than once, and it was to Sermak
    that he said:



    "I've been particularly anxious to see you, Councilman, ever since your very excellent speech
    last month. Your attack on the foreign policy of this government was a most capable one."

    Sermak's eyes smoldered. "Your interest honors me. The attack may or may not have been
    capable, but it was certainly justified."

    "Perhaps! Your opinions are yours, of course. Still you are rather young."

    Dryly. "It is a fault that most people are guilty of at some period of their life. You became mayor
    of the city when you were two years younger than I am now."

    Hardin smiled to himself. The yearling was a cool customer. He said, "I take it now that you
    have come to see me concerning this same foreign policy that annoys you so greatly in the
    Council Chamber. Are you speaking for your three colleagues, or must I listen to each of you
    separately?" There were quick mutual glances among the four young men, a slight flickering of
    eyelids.

    Sermak said grimly, "I speak for the people of Terminus - a people who are not now truly
    represented in the rubberstamp body they call the Council."

    "I see. Go ahead, then!"

    "It comes to this, Mr. Mayor. We are dissatisfied-"

    "By 'we' you mean 'the people,' don't you?"

    Sermak stared hostilely, sensing a trap, and replied coldly, "I believe that my views reflect those
    of the majority of the voters of Terminus. Does that suit you?"

    "Well, a statement like that is all the better for proof, but go on, anyway. You are dissatisfied."

    "Yes, dissatisfied with the policy which for thirty years had been stripping Terminus defenseless
    against the inevitable attack from outside."

    "I see. And therefore? Go on, go on."

    "It's nice of you to anticipate. And therefore we are forming a new political party; one that will
    stand for the immediate needs of Terminus and not for a mystic 'manifest destiny' of future
    Empire. We are going to throw you and your lick-spittle clique of appeasers out of City Hall-and
    that soon."

    "Unless? There's always an 'unless,' you know."

    "Not much of one in this case: Unless you resign now. I'm not asking you to change your
    policies - I wouldn't trust you that far. Your promises are worth nothing. An outright resignation
    is all we'll take."

    "I see." Hardin crossed his legs and teetered his chair back on two legs. "That's your ultimatum.
    Nice of you to give me warning. But, you see, I rather think I'll ignore it."

    "Don't think it was a warning, Mr. Mayor. It was an announcement of principles and of action.
    The new party has already been formed, and it will begin its official activities tomorrow. There is



    neither room nor desire for compromise, and, frankly, it was only our recognition of your
    services to the City that induced us to offer the easy way out. I didn't think you'd take it, but my
    conscience is clear.

    The next election will be a more forcible and quite irresistible reminder that resignation is
    necessary."

    He rose and motioned the rest up.

    Hardin lifted his arm. "Hold on! Sit down!"

    Sef Sermak seated himself once more with just a shade too much alacrity and Hardin smiled
    behind a straight face. In spite of his words, he was waiting for an offer.

    Hardin said, "In exactly what way do you want our foreign policy changed? Do you want us to
    attack the Four Kingdoms, now, at once, and all four simultaneously?"

    "I make no such suggestion, Mr. Mayor. It is our simple proposition that all appeasement cease
    immediately. Throughout your administration, you have carried out a policy of scientific aid to
    the Kingdoms. You have given them nuclear power. You have helped rebuild power plants on
    their territories. You have established medical clinics, chemical laboratories and factories."

    "Well? And your objection?"

    "You have done this in order to keep them from attacking us. With these as bribes, you have
    been playing the fool in a colossal game of blackmail, in which you have allowed Terminus to
    be sucked dry - with the result that now we are at the mercy of these barbarians."

    "In what way?"

    "Because you have given them power, given them weapons, actually serviced the ships of their
    navies, they are infinitely stronger than they were three decades ago. Their demands are
    increasing, and with their new weapons, they will eventually satisfy all their demands at once by
    violent annexation of Terminus. Isn't that the way blackmail usually ends?"

    "And your remedy?"

    "Stop the bribes immediately and while you can. Spend your effort in strengthening Terminus
    itself - and attack first!"

    Hardin watched the young fellow's little blond mustache with an almost morbid interest. Sermak
    felt sure of himself or he wouldn't talk so much. There was no doubt that his remarks were the
    reflection of a pretty huge segment of the population, pretty huge.


    His voice did not betray the slightly perturbed current of his thoughts. If was almost negligent.
    "Are you finished?"

    "For the moment."

    "Well, then, do you notice the framed statement I have on the wall behind me? Read it, if you



    will!


    Sermak's lips twitched. "It says: 'Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' That's an old
    man's doctrine, Mr. Mayor."

    "I applied it as a young man, Mr. Councilman - and successfully. You were busily being born
    when it happened, but perhaps you may have read something of it in school."

    He eyed Sermak closely and continued in measured tones, "When Hari Seldon established the
    Foundation here, it was for the ostensible purpose of producing a great Encyclopedia, and for
    fifty years we followed that will-of-the-wisp, before discovering what he was really after. By that
    time, it was almost too late. When communications with the central regions of the old Empire
    broke down, we found ourselves a world of scientists concentrated in a single city, possessing
    no industries, and surrounded by newly created kingdoms, hostile and largely barbarous. We
    were a tiny island of nuclear power in this ocean of barbarism, and an infinitely valuable prize.

    "Anacreon, then as now, the most powerful of the Four Kingdoms, demanded and later actually
    established a military base upon Terminus, and the then rulers of the City, the Encyclopedists,
    knew very well that this was only a preliminary to taking over the entire planet. That is how
    matters stood when I ... uh ... assumed actual government. What would you have done?"

    Sermak shrugged his shoulders. "That's an academic question. Of course, I know what you
    did."

    "I'll repeat it, anyway. Perhaps you don't get the point. The temptation was great to muster what
    force we could and put up a fight. It's the easiest way out, and the most satisfactory to
    self-respect - but, nearly invariably, the stupidest. You would have done it; you and your talk of
    'attack first.' What I did, instead, was to visit the three other kingdoms, one by one; point out to
    each that to allow the secret of nuclear power to fall into the hands of Anacreon was the
    quickest way of cutting their own throats; and suggest gently that they do the obvious thing.

    That was all. One month after the Anacreonian force had landed on Terminus, their king
    received a joint ultimatum from his three neighbors. In seven days, the last Anacreonian was off
    Terminus.

    Now tell me, where was the need for violence?"

    The young councilman regarded his cigar stub thoughtfully and tossed it into the incinerator
    chute. "I fail to see the analogy. Insulin will bring a diabetic to normal without the faintest need
    of a knife, but appendicitis needs an operation. You can't help that. When other courses have
    failed, what is left but, as you put it, the last refuge? It's your fault that we're driven to it."

    "I? Oh, yes, again my policy of appeasement. You still seem to lack grasp of the fundamental
    necessities of our position. Our problem wasn't over with the departure of the Anacreonians.
    They had just begun. The Four Kingdoms were more our enemies than ever, for each wanted
    nuclear power-and each was kept off our throats only for fear of the other three. We are
    balanced on the point of a very sharp sword, and the slightest sway in any direction - If, for
    instance, one kingdom becomes too strong; or if two form a coalition - You understand?"

    "Certainly. That was the time to begin all-out preparations for war."



    "On the contrary. That was the time to begin all-out prevention of war. I played them one
    against the other. I helped each in turn. I offered them science, trade, education, scientific
    medicine. I made Terminus of more value to them as a flourishing world than as a military prize.
    It worked for thirty years."

    "Yes, but you were forced to surround these scientific gifts with the most outrageous mummery.
    You've made half religion, half balderdash out of it. You've erected a hierarchy of priests and
    complicated, meaningless ritual."

    Hardin frowned. "What of that? I don't see that it has anything to do with the argument at all. I
    started that way at first because the barbarians looked upon our science as a sort of magical
    sorcery, and it was easiest to get them to accept it on that basis. The priesthood built itself and
    if we help it along we are only following the line of least resistance. It is a minor matter."

    "But these priests are in charge of the power plants. That is not a minor matter."

    "True, but we have trained them. Their knowledge of their tools is purely empirical; and they
    have a firm belief in the mummery that surrounds them."

    "And if one pierces through the mummery, and has the genius to brush aside empiricism, what
    is to prevent him from learning actual techniques, and selling out to the most satisfactory
    bidder? What price our value to the kingdoms, then?"

    "Little chance of that, Sermak. You are being superficial. The best men on the planets of the
    kingdoms are sent here to the Foundation each year and educated into the priesthood. And the
    best of these remain here as research students. If you think that those who are left, with
    practically no knowledge of the elements of science, or worse, still, with the distorted
    knowledge the priests receive, can penetrate at a bound to nuclear power, to electronics, to the
    theory of the hyperwarp - you have a very romantic and very foolish idea of science. It takes
    lifetimes of training and an excellent brain to get that far."

    Yohan Lee had risen abruptly during the foregoing speech and left the room. He had returned
    now and when Hardin finished speaking, he bent to his superior's ear. A whisper was
    exchanged and then a leaden cylinder. Then, with one short hostile look at the deputation, Lee
    resumed his chair.

    Hardin turned the cylinder end for end in his hands, watching the deputation through his lashes.
    And then he opened it with a hard, sudden twist and only Sermak had the sense not to throw a
    rapid look at the rolled paper that fell out.

    "In short, gentlemen," he said, "the Government is of the opinion that it knows what it is doing."

    He read as he spoke. There were the lines of intricate, meaningless code that covered the
    page and the three penciled words scrawled in one comer that carried the message. He took it
    in at a glance and tossed it casually into the incinerator shaft.

    "That," Hardin then said, "ends the interview, I'm afraid. Glad to have met you all. Thank you for
    coming." He shook hands with each in perfunctory fashion, and they filed out.

    Hardin had almost gotten out of the habit of laughing, but after Sermak and his three silent



    partners were well out of earshot, he indulged in a dry chuckle and bent an amused look on
    Lee.

    "How did you like that battle of bluffs, Lee?"

    Lee snorted grumpily. "I'm not sure that he was bluffing. Treat him with kid gloves and he's
    quite liable to win the next election, just as he says."

    "Oh, quite likely, quite likely - if nothing happens first."

    "Make sure they don't happen in the wrong direction this time, Hardin. I tell you this Sermak has
    a following. What if he doesn't wait till the next election? There was a time when you and I put
    things through violently, in spite of your slogan about what violence is."

    Hardin cocked an eyebrow. "You are pessimistic today, Lee. And singularly contrary, too, or
    you wouldn't speak of violence. Our own little putsch was carried through without loss of life,
    you remember. It was a necessary measure put through at the proper moment, and went over
    smoothly, painlessly, and all but effortlessly. As for Sermak, he's up against a different
    proposition. You and I, Lee, aren't the Encyclopedists. We stand prepared. Order your men
    onto these youngsters in a nice way, old fellow. Don't let them know they're being watched -
    but eyes open, you understand."

    Lee laughed in sour amusement. "I'd be a fine one to wait for your orders, wouldn't I, Hardin?
    Sermak and his men have been under surveillance for a month now."

    The mayor chuckled. "Got in first, did you? All right. By the way," he observed, and added
    softly, "Ambassador Verisof is returning to Terminus. Temporarily, I hope."

    There was a short silence, faintly horrified, and then Lee said, "Was that the message? Are
    things breaking already?"

    "Don't know. I can't tell till I hear what Verisof has to say. They may be, though. After all, they
    have to before election. But what are you looking so dead about?"

    "Because I don't know how it's going to turn out. You're too deep, Hardin, and you're playing
    the game too close to your chest."

    "Even you?" murmured Hardin. And aloud, "Does that mean you're going to join Sermak's new
    party?"

    Lee smiled against his will. "All right. You win. How about lunch now?"


    2 .

    There are many epigrams attributed to Hardin - a confirmed epigrammatist - a good many of
    which are probably apocryphal. Nevertheless, it is reported that on a certain occasion, he said:

    "It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety."

    Poly Verisof had had occasion to act on that advice more than once for he was now in the



    fourteenth year of his double status on Anacreon - a double status the upkeep of which
    reminded him often and unpleasantly of a dance performed barefoot on hot metal.

    To the people of Anacreon he was high priest, representative of that Foundation which, to
    those "barbarians," was the acme of mystery and the physical center of this religion they had
    created - with Hardin's help - in the last three decades. As such, he received a homage that
    had become horribly wearying, for from his soul he despised the ritual of which he was the
    center.

    But to the King of Anacreon - the old one that had been, and the young grandson that was now
    on the throne - he was simply the ambassador of a power at once feared and coveted.

    On the whole, it was an uncomfortable job, and his first trip to the Foundation in three years,
    despite the disturbing incident that had made it necessary, was something in the nature of a
    holiday.

    And since it was not the first time he had had to travel in absolute secrecy, he again made use
    of Hardin's epigram on the uses of the obvious.

    He changed into his civilian clothes - a holiday in itself - and boarded a passenger liner to the
    Foundation, second class. Once at Terminus, he threaded his way through the crowd at the
    spaceport and called up City Hall at a public visiphone.

    He said, "My name is Jan Smite. I have an appointment with the mayor this afternoon."

    The dead-voiced but efficient young lady at the other end made a second connection and
    exchanged a few rapid words, then said to Verisof in dry, mechanical tone, "Mayor Hardin will
    see you in half an hour, sir," and the screen went blank.

    Whereupon the ambassador to Anacreon bought the latest edition of the Terminus City Journal,
    sauntered casually to City Hall Park and, sitting, down on the first empty bench he came to,
    read the editorial page, sport section and comic sheet while waiting. At the end of half an hour,
    he tucked the paper under his arm, entered City Hall and presented himself in the anteroom.

    In doing all this he remained safely and thoroughly unrecognized, for since he was so entirely
    obvious, no one gave him a second look.

    Hardin looked up at him and grinned. "Have a cigar! How was the trip?"

    Verisof helped himself. "Interesting. There was a priest in the next cabin on his way here to
    take a special course in the preparation of radioactive synthetics - for the treatment of cancer,
    you know

    "Surely, he didn't call it radioactive synthetics, now?"

    "I guess not! It was the Holy Food to him."

    The mayor smiled. "Go on."

    "He inveigled me into a theological discussion and did his level best to elevate me out of sordid
    materialism."



    "And never recognized his own high priest?"

    "Without my crimson robe? Besides, he was a Smyrnian. It was an interesting experience,
    though. It is remarkable, Hardin, how the religion of science has grabbed hold. I've written an
    essay on the subject - entirely for my own amusement; it wouldn't do to have it published.
    Treating the problem sociologically, it would seem that when the old Empire began to rot at the
    fringes, it could be considered that science, as science, had failed the outer worlds. To be
    reaccepted it would have to present itself in another guise and it has done just that. It works out
    beautifully."

    "Interesting!" The mayor placed his arms around his neck and said suddenly, "Start talking
    about the situation at Anacreon!"

    The ambassador frowned and withdrew the cigar from his mouth. He looked at it distastefully
    and put it down. "Well, it's pretty bad."

    "You wouldn't be here, otherwise."

    "Scarcely. Here's the position. The key man at Anacreon is the Prince Regent, Wienis. He's
    King Lepold's uncle."

    "I know. But Lepold is coming of age next year, isn't he? I believe he'll be sixteen in February."

    "Yes." Pause, and then a wry addition. "If he lives. The king's father died under suspicious
    circumstances. A needle bullet through the chest during a hunt. It was called an accident."


    "Hmph. I seem to remember Wienis the time I was on Anacreon, when we kicked them off
    Terminus. It was before your time. Let's see now. If I remember, he was a dark young fellow,
    black hair and a squint in his right eye. He had a funny hook in his nose."

    "Same fellow. The hook and the squint are still there, but his hair's gray now. He plays the
    game dirty. Luckily, he's the most egregious fool on the planet. Fancies himself as a shrewd
    devil, too, which mades his folly the more transparent."

    "That's usually the way."

    "His notion of cracking an egg is to shoot a nuclear blast at it. Witness the tax on Temple
    property he tried to impose just after the old king died two years ago. Remember?"

    Hardin nodded thoughtfully, then smiled. "The priests raised a howl."

    "They raised one you could hear way out to Lucreza. He's shown more caution in dealing with
    the priesthood since, but he still manages to do things the hard way. In a way, it's unfortunate
    for us; he has unlimited self-confidence."

    "Probably an over-compensated inferiority complex. Younger sons of royalty get that way, you
    know."


    But it amounts to the same thing. He's foaming at the mouth with eagerness to attack the



    Foundation. He scarcely troubles to conceal it. And he's in a position to do it, too, from the
    standpoint of armament. The old king built up a magnificent navy, and Wienis hasn't been
    sleeping the last two years. In fact, the tax on Temple property was originally intended for
    further armament, and when that fell through he increased the income tax twice."

    "Any grumbling at that?"

    "None of serious importance. Obedience to appointed authority was the text of every sermon in
    the kingdom for weeks. Not that Wienis showed any gratitude."

    "All right. I've got the background. Now what's happened?"

    "Two weeks ago an Anacreonian merchant ship came across a derelict battle cruiser of the old
    Imperial Navy. It must have been drifting in space for at least three centuries."

    Interest flickered in Hardin's eyes. He sat up. "Yes, I've heard of that. The Board of Navigation
    has sent me a petition asking me to obtain the ship for purposes of study. It is in good
    condition, I understand."

    "In entirely too good condition," responded Verisof, dryly. "When Wienis received your
    suggestion last week that he turn the ship over to the Foundation, he almost had convulsions."

    "He hasn't answered yet."

    "He won't - except with guns, or so he thinks. You see, he came to me on the day I left
    Anacreon and requested that the Foundation put this battle cruiser into fighting order and turn it
    over to the Anacreonian navy. He had the infernal gall to say that your note of last week
    indicated a plan of the Foundation's to attack Anacreon. He said that refusal to repair the battle
    cruiser would confirm his suspicions; and indicated that measures for the self-defense of
    Anacreon would be forced upon him. Those are his words. Forced upon him! And that's why I'm
    here."

    Hardin laughed gently.

    Verisof smiled and continued, "Of course, he expects a refusal, and it would be a perfect
    excuse - in his eyes - for immediate attack."

    "I see that, Verisof. Well, we have at least six months to spare, so have the ship fixed up and
    present it with my compliments. Have it renamed the Wienis as a mark of our esteem and
    affection."

    He laughed again.

    And again Verisof responded with the faintest trace of a smile, "I suppose it's the logical step,
    Hardin - but I'm worried."

    "What about?"

    "It's a ship! They could build in those days. Its cubic capacity is half again that of the entire
    Anacreonian navy. It's got nuclear blasts capable of blowing up a planet, and a shield that could
    take a Q-beam without working up radiation. Too much of a good thing, Hardin



    "Superficial, Verisof, superficial. You and I both know that the armament he now has could
    defeat Terminus handily, long before we could repair the cruiser for our own use. What does it
    matter, then, if we give him the cruiser as well? You know it won't ever come to actual war."

    "I suppose so. Yes." The ambassador looked up. "But Hardin

    "Well? Why do you stop? Go ahead."

    "Look. This isn't my province. But I've been reading the paper." He placed the Journal on the
    desk and indicated the front page. "What's this all about?"

    Hardin dropped a casual glance. "'A group of Councilmen are forming a new political party.'"

    "That's what it says." Verisof fidgeted. "I know you're in better touch with internal matters than I
    am, but they're attacking you with everything short of physical violence. How strong are they?"

    "Damned strong. They'll probably control the Council after next election."

    "Not before?" Verisof looked at the mayor obliquely. "There are ways of gaining control besides
    elections."

    "Do you take me for Wienis?"

    "No. But repairing the ship will take months and an attack after that is certain. Our yielding will
    be taken as a sign of appalling weakness and the addition of the Imperial Cruiser will just about
    double the strength of Wienis' navy. He'll attack as sure as I'm a high priest. Why take
    chances? Do one of two things. Either reveal the plan of campaign to the Council, or force the
    issue with Anacreon now!"

    Hardin frowned. "Force the issue now? Before the crisis comes? It's the one thing I mustn't do.
    There's Hari Seldon and the Plan, you know."

    Verisof hesitated, then muttered, "You're absolutely sure, then, that there is a Plan?"

    "There can scarcely be any doubt," came the stiff reply. "I was present at the opening of the
    Time Vault and Seldon's recording revealed it then."

    "I didn't mean that, Hardin. I just don't see how it could be possible to chart history for a
    thousand years ahead. Maybe Seldon overestimated himself." He shriveled a bit at Hardin's
    ironical smile, and added, "Well, I'm no psychologist,"

    "Exactly. None of us are. But I did receive some elementary training in my youth - enough to
    know what psychology is capable of, even if I can't exploit its capabilities myself. There's no
    doubt but that Seldon did exactly what he claims to have done. The Foundation, as he says,
    was established as a scientific refuge - the means by which the science and culture of the
    dying Empire was to be preserved through the centuries of barbarism that have begun, to be
    rekindled in the end into a second Empire."

    Verisof nodded, a trifle doubtfully. "Everyone knows that's the way things are supposed to go.



    But can we afford to take chances? Can we risk the present for the sake of a nebulous future?"

    "We must - because the future isn't nebulous. It's been calculated out by Seldon and charted.
    Each successive crisis in our history is mapped and each depends in a measure on the
    successful conclusion of the ones previous. This is only the second crisis and Space knows
    what effect even a trifling deviation would have in the end."

    "That's rather empty speculation."

    "No! Hari Seldon said in the Time Vault, that at each crisis our freedom of action would become
    circumscribed to the point where only one course of action was possible."

    "So as to keep us on the straight and narrow?"

    "So as to keep us from deviating, yes. But, conversely, as long as more than one course of
    action is possible, the crisis has not been reached. We must let things drift so long as we
    possibly can, and by space, that's what I intend doing."

    Verisof didn't answer. He chewed his lower lip in a grudging silence. It had only been the year
    before that Hardin had first discussed the problem with him - the real problem; the problem of
    countering Anacreon's hostile preparations. And then only because he, Verisof, had balked at
    further appeasement.

    Hardin seemed to follow his ambassador's thoughts. "I would much rather never to have told
    you anything about this."

    "What makes you say that?" cried Verisof, in surprise.

    "Because there are six people now - you and I, the other three ambassadors and Yohan Lee -
    who have a fair notion of what's ahead; and I'm damned afraid that it was Seldon's idea to have
    no one know."

    "Why so?"

    "Because even Seldon's advanced psychology was limited. It could not handle too many
    independent variables. He couldn't work with individuals over any length of time; any more than
    you could apply kinetic theory of gases to single molecules. He worked with mobs, populations
    of whole planets, and only blind mobs who do not possess foreknowledge of the results of their
    own actions."

    "That's not plain."

    "I can't help it. I'm not psychologist enough to explain it scientifically. But this you know. There
    are no trained psychologists on Terminus and no mathematical texts on the science. It is plain
    that he wanted no one on Terminus capable of working out the future in advance. Seldon
    wanted us to proceed blindly - and therefore correctly - according to the law of mob
    psychology. As I once told you, I never knew where we were heading when I first drove out the
    Anacreonians. My idea had been to maintain balance of power, no more than that. It was only
    afterward that I thought I saw a pattern in events; but I've done my level best not to act on that
    knowledge. Interference due to foresight would have knocked the Plan out of kilter."



    Verisof nodded thoughtfully. "I've heard arguments almost as complicated in the Temples back
    on Anacreon. How do you expect to spot the fight moment of action?"

    "It's spotted already. You admit that once we repair the battle cruiser nothing will stop Wienis
    from attacking us. There will no longer be any alternative in that respect."

    "Yes

    "All right. That accounts for the external aspect. Meanwhile, you'll further admit that the next
    election will see a new and hostile Council that will force action against Anacreon. There is no
    alternative there."

    "Yes."

    "And as soon as all the alternatives disappear, the crisis has come. Just the same - I get
    worried."

    He paused, and Verisof waited. Slowly, almost reluctantly, Hardin continued, "I've got the idea
    -just a notion - that the external and internal pressures were planned to come to a head
    simultaneously. As it is, there's a few months difference. Wienis will probably attack before
    spring, and elections are still a year off."

    "That doesn't sound important."

    "I don't know. It may be due merely to unavoidable errors of calculation, or it might be due to
    the fact that I knew too much. I tried never to let my foresight influence my action, but how can I
    tell? And what effect will the discrepancy have? Anyway," he looked up, "there's one thing I've
    decided."

    "And what's that?"

    "When the crisis does begin to break, I'm going to Anacreon. I want to be on the spot ... Oh,
    that's enough, Verisof. It's getting late. Let's go out and make a night of it. I want some
    relaxation."


    "Then get it right here,' said Verisof. "I don't want to be recognized, or you know what this new
    party your precious Councilmen are forming would say. Call for the brandy."

    And Hardin did - but not for too much.

    In the ancient days when the Galactic Empire had embraced the Galaxy, and Anacreon had
    been the richest of the prefects of the Periphery, more than one emperor had visited the
    Viceregal Palace in state. And not one had left without at least one effort to pit his skill with air
    speedster and needle gun against the feathered flying fortress they call the Nyakbird.

    The fame of Anacreon had withered to nothing with the decay of the times. The Viceregal



    Palace was a drafty mass of ruins except for the wing that Foundation workmen had restored.
    And no Emperor had been seen in Anacreon for two hundred years.

    But Nyak hunting was still the royal sport and a good eye with the needle gun still the first
    requirement of Anacreon's kings.

    Lepold I, King of Anacreon and - as was invariably, but untruthfully added - Lord of the Outer
    Dominions, though not yet sixteen had already proved his skill many times over. He had
    brought down his first Nyak when scarcely thirteen; had brought down his tenth the week after
    his accession to the throne; and was returning now from his forty-sixth.

    "Fifty before I come of age," he had exulted. "Who'll take the wager?"

    But Courtiers don't take wagers against the king's skill. There is the deadly danger of winning.
    So no one did, and the king left to change his clothes in high spirits.

    "Lepold!"

    The king stopped mid-step at the one voice that could cause him to do so. He turned sulkily.
    Wienis stood upon the threshold of his chambers and beetled at his young nephew.

    "Send them away," he motioned impatiently. "Get rid of them."

    The king nodded curtly and the two chamberlains bowed and backed down the stairs. Lepold
    entered his uncle's room.

    Wienis stared at the king's hunting suit morosely. "You'll have more important things to tend to
    than Nyak hunting soon enough."

    He turned his back and stumped to his desk. Since he had grown too old for the rush of air, the
    perilous dive within wing-beat of the Nyak, the roll and climb of the speedster at the motion of a
    foot, he had soured upon the whole sport.

    Lepold appreciated his uncle's sour-grapes attitude and it was not without malice that he began
    enthusiastically, "But you should have been with us today, uncle. We flushed one in the wilds of
    Sarnia that was a monster. And game as they come. We had it out for two hours over at least
    seventy square miles of ground. And then I got to Sunwards - he was motioning graphically, as
    though he were once more in his speedster -"and dived torque-wise. Caught him on the rise
    just under the left wing at quarters. It maddened him and he canted athwart. I took his dare and
    veered a-left, waiting for the plummet. Sure enough, down he came. He was within wing-beat
    before I moved and then

    "Lepold!"

    "Well!- I got him."

    "I'm sure you did. Now will you attend?"

    The king shrugged and gravitated to the end table where he nibbled at a Lera nut in quite an
    unregal sulk. He did not dare to meet his uncle's eyes.



    Wienis said, by way of preamble, "I've been to the ship today."

    "What ship?"

    "There is only one ship. The ship. The one the Foundation is repairing for the navy. The old
    Imperial cruiser. Do I make myself sufficiently plain?"

    "That one? You see, I told you the Foundation would repair it if we asked them to. It's all
    poppycock, you know, that story of yours about their wanting to attack us. Because if they did,
    why would they fix the ship? It doesn't make sense, you know."

    "Lepold, you're a fool!"

    The king, who had just discarded the shell of the Lera nut and was lifting another to his lips,
    flushed.

    "Well now, look here," he said, with anger that scarcely rose above peevishness, "I don't think
    you ought to call me that. You forget yourself. I'll be of age in two months, you know."

    "Yes, and you're in a fine position to assume regal responsibilities. If you spent half the time on
    public affairs that you do on Nyak hunting, I'd resign the regency directly with a clear
    conscience."

    "I don't care. That has nothing to do with the case, you know. The fact is that even if you are
    the regent and my uncle, I'm still king and you're still my subject. You oughtn't to call me a fool
    and you oughtn't to sit in my presence, anyway. You haven't asked my permission. I think you
    ought to be careful, or I might do something about it pretty soon."

    Wienis' gaze was cold. "May I refer to you as 'your majesty'?"

    "Yes."

    "Very well! You are a fool, your majesty!"

    His dark eyes blazed from beneath his grizzled brows and the young king sat down slowly. For
    a moment, there was sardonic satisfaction in the regent's face, but it faded quickly. His thick
    lips parted in a smile and one hand fell upon the king's shoulder.

    "Never mind, Lepold. I should not have spoken harshly to you. It is difficult sometimes to
    behave with true propriety when the pressure of events is such as - You understand?" But if
    the words were conciliatory, there was something in his eyes that had not softened.

    Lepold said uncertainly, "Yes. Affairs of State are deuced difficult, you know." He wondered, not
    without apprehension, whether he were not in for a dull siege of meaningless details on the
    year's trade with Smyrno and the long, wrangling dispute over the sparsely settled worlds on
    the Red Corridor.

    Wienis was speaking again. "My boy, I had thought to speak of this to you earlier, and perhaps
    I should have, but I know that your youthful spirits are impatient of the dry detail of statecraft."

    Lepold nodded. "Well, that's all right-"



    His uncle broke in firmly and continued, "However, you will come of age in two months.
    Moreover, in the difficult times that are coming, you will have to take a full and active part. You
    will be king henceforward, Lepold."

    Again Lepold nodded, but his expression was quite blank.

    "There will be war, Lepold."

    "War! But there's been truce with Smyrno-"

    "Not Smyrno. The Foundation itself."

    "But, uncle, they've agreed to repair the ship. You said-"

    His voice choked off at the twist of his uncle's lip.

    "Lepold" - some of the friendliness had gone -"we are to talk man to man. There is to be war
    with the Foundation, whether the ship is repaired or not; all the sooner, in fact, since it is being
    repaired. The Foundation is the source of power and might. All the greatness of Anacreon; all
    its ships and its cities and its people and its commerce depend on the dribbles and leavings of
    power that the Foundation have given us grudgingly. I remember the time - I, myself - when
    the cities of Anacreon were warmed by the burning of coal and oil. But never mind that; you
    would have no conception of it."

    "It seems," suggested the king timidly, "that we ought to be grateful-"

    "Grateful?" roared Wienis. "Grateful that they begrudge us the merest dregs, while keeping
    space knows what for themselves - and keeping it with what purpose in mind? Why, only that
    they may some day rule the Galaxy."

    His hand came down on his nephew's knee, and his eyes narrowed. "Lepold, you are king of
    Anacreon. Your children and your children's children may be kings of the universe - if you have
    the power that the Foundation is keeping from us!"

    "There's something in that." Lepold's eyes gained a sparkle and his back straightened. "After
    all, what right have they to keep it to themselves? Not fair, you know. Anacreon counts for
    something, too."

    "You see, you're beginning to understand. And now, my boy, what if Smyrno decides to attack
    the Foundation for its own part and thus gains all that power? How long do you suppose we
    could escape becoming a vassal power? How long would you hold your throne?"

    Lepold grew excited. "Space, yes. You're absolutely right, you know. We must strike first. It's
    simply self-defense."

    Wienis' smile broadened slightly. "Furthermore, once, at the very beginning of the reign of your
    grandfather, Anacreon actually established a military base on the Foundation's planet,

    Terminus - a base vitally needed for national defense. We were forced to abandon that base
    as a result of the machinations of the leader of that Foundation, a sly cur, a scholar, with not a
    drop of noble blood in his veins. You understand, Lepold? Your grandfather was humiliated by
    this commoner. I remember him! He was scarcely older than myself when he came to



    Anacreon with his devil's smile and devil's brain - and the power of the other three kingdoms
    behind him, combined in cowardly union against the greatness of Anacreon."

    Lepold flushed and the sparkle in his eyes blazed. "By Seldon, if I had been my grandfather, I
    would have fought even so."

    "No, Lepold. We decided to wait - to wipe out the insult at a fitter time. It had been your father's
    hope, before his untimely death, that he might be the one to - Well, well!" Wienis turned away
    for a moment. Then, as if stifling emotion, "He was my brother. And yet, if his son were-"

    "Yes, uncle, I'll not fail him. I have decided. It seems only proper that Anacreon wipe out this
    nest of troublemakers, and that immediately."

    "No, not immediately. First, we must wait for the repairs of the battle cruiser to be completed.
    The mere fact that they are willing to undertake these repairs proves that they fear us. The
    fools attempt to placate us, but we are not to be turned from our path, are we?"

    And Lepold's fist slammed against his cupped palm.

    "Not while I am king in Anacreon."

    Wienis' lip twitched sardonically. "Besides which we must wait for Salvor Hardin to arrive."

    "Salvor Hardin!" The king grew suddenly round-eyed, and the youthful contour of his beardless
    face lost the almost hard lines into which they had been compressed.

    "Yes, Lepold, the leader of the Foundation himself is coming to Anacreon on your birthday -
    probably to soothe us with buttered words. But it won't help him."

    "Salvor Hardin!" It was the merest murmur.

    Wienis frowned. "Are you afraid of the name? It is the same Salvor Hardin, who on his previous
    visit, ground our noses into the dust. You're not forgetting that deadly insult to the royal house?
    And from a commoner. The dregs of the gutter."

    "No. I guess not. No, I won't. I won't! We'll pay him back - but.. .but - I'm afraid - a little."

    The regent rose. "Afraid? Of what? Of what, you young-" He choked off.

    "It would be. ..uh.. .sort of blasphemous, you know, to attack the Foundation. I mean-" He
    paused.

    "Go on."

    Lepold said confusedly, "I mean, if there were really a Galactic Spirit, he...uh...it mightn't like it.
    Don't you think?

    "No, I don't," was the hard answer. Wienis sat down again and his lips twisted in a queer smile.
    "And so you

    really bother your head a great deal over the Galactic Spirit, do you? That's what comes of
    letting you run wild. You've been listening to Verisof quite a bit, I take it."



    He's explained a great deal-'
    About the Galactic Spirit?"


    "Yes."

    "Why, you unweaned cub, he believes in that mummery a good deal less than I do, and I don't
    believe in it at all. How many times have you been told that all this talk is nonsense?"

    "Well, I know that. But Verisof says-"

    "Pay no heed to Verisof. It's nonsense."

    There was a short, rebellious silence, and then Lepold said, "Everyone believes it just the
    same. I mean all this talk about the Prophet Hari Seldon and how he appointed the Foundation
    to carry on his commandments that there might some day be a return of the Galactic Paradise:
    and how anyone who disobeys his commandments will be destroyed for eternity. They believe
    it. I've presided at festivals, and I'm sure they do."

    "Yes, they do ; but we don't. And you may be thankful it's so, for according to this foolishness,
    you are king by divine right - and are semi-divine yourself. Very handy. It eliminates all
    possibilities of revolts and insures absolute obedience in everything. And that is why, Lepold,
    you must take an active part in ordering the war against the Foundation. I am only regent, and
    quite human. You are king, and more than half a god - to them."

    "But I suppose I'm not really," said the king reflectively.

    "No, not really," came the sardonic response, "but you are to everyone but the people of the
    Foundation. Get that? To everyone but those of the Foundation. Once they are removed there
    will be no one to deny you the godhead. Think of that!"

    "And after that we will ourselves be able to operate the power boxes of the temples and the
    ships that fly without men and the holy food that cures cancer and all the rest? Verisof said only
    those blessed with the Galactic Spirit could-"

    "Yes, Verisof said! Verisof, next to Salvor Hardin, is your greatest enemy. Stay with me, Lepold,
    and don't worry about them. Together we will recreate an empire-not just the kingdom of
    Anacreon-but one comprising every one of the billions of suns of the Empire. Is that better than
    a wordy 'Galactic Paradise'?"

    "Ye-es."

    "Can Verisof promise more?"

    "No."

    "Very well." His voice became peremptory. "I suppose we may consider the matter settled." He
    waited for no answer. "Get along. I'll be down later. And just one thing, Lepold."

    The young king turned on the threshold.



    Wienis was smiling with all but his eyes. "Be careful on these Nyak hunts, my boy. Since the
    unfortunate accident to your father, I have had the strangest presentiments concerning you, at
    times. In the confusion, with needle guns thickening the air with darts, one can never tell. You
    will be careful, I hope. And you'll do as I say about the Foundation, won't you?"

    Lepold's eyes widened and dropped away from those of his uncle. "Yes - certainly."

    "Good!" He stared after his departing nephew, expressionlessly, and returned to his desk.

    And Lepold's thoughts as he left were somber and not unfearful. Perhaps it would be best to
    defeat the Foundation and gain the power Wienis spoke of. But afterward, when the war was
    over and he was secure on his throne- He became acutely conscious of the fact that Wienis
    and his two arrogant sons were at present next in line to the throne.

    But he was king. And kings could order people executed.

    Even uncles and cousins.


    4 .

    Next to Sermak himself, Lewis Bort was the most active in rallying those dissident elements
    which had fused into the now-vociferous Action Party. Yet he had not been one of the
    deputation that had called on Salvor Hardin almost half a year previously. That this was so was
    not due to any lack of recognition of his efforts; quite the contrary. He was absent for the very
    good reason that he was on Anacreon's capital world at the time.

    He visited it as a private citizen. He saw no official and he did nothing of importance. He merely
    watched the obscure comers of the busy planet and poked his stubby nose into dusty crannies.

    He arrived home toward the end of a short winter day that had started with clouds and was
    finishing with snow and within an hour was seated at the octagonal table in Sermak's home.

    His first words were not calculated to improve the atmosphere of a gathering already
    considerably depressed by the deepening snow-filled twilight outside..

    "I'm afraid," he said, "that our position is what is usually termed, in melodramatic phraseology, a
    'Lost Cause.'"

    "You think so?" said Sermak, gloomily.

    "It's gone past thought, Sermak. There's no room for any other opinion."

    "Armaments-" began Dokor Walto, somewhat officiously, but Bort broke in at once.

    "Forget that. That's an old story." His eyes traveled round the circle. "I'm referring to the people.

    I admit that it was my idea originally that we attempt to foster a palace rebellion of some sort to
    install as king someone more favorable to the Foundation. It was a good idea. It still is. The
    only trifling flaw about it is that it is impossible. The great Salvor Hardin saw to that."



    Sermak said sourly, "If you'd give us the details, Bort-"

    "Details! There aren't any! It isn't as simple as that. It's the whole damned situation on
    Anacreon. It's this religion the Foundation has established. It works!"

    "Well!"

    "You've got to see it work to appreciate it. All you see here is that we have a large school
    devoted to the training of priests, and that occasionally a special show is put on in some
    obscure comer of the city for the benefit of pilgrims and that's all. The whole business hardly
    affects us as a general thing. But on Anacreon-"

    Lem Tarki smoothed his prim little Vandyke with one finger, and cleared his throat. "What kind
    of religion is it? Hardin's always said that it was just a fluffy flummery to get them to accept our
    science without question. You remember, Sermak, he told us that day-"

    "Hardin's explanations," reminded Sermak, "don't often mean much at face value. But what kind
    of a religion is it, Bort?"

    Bort considered. "Ethically, it's fine. It scarcely varies from the various philosophies of the old
    Empire. High moral standards and all that. There's nothing to complain about from that
    viewpoint. Religion is one of the great civilizing influences of history and in that respect, it's
    fulfilling-"

    "We know that," interrupted Sermak, impatiently. "Get to the point."

    "Here it is." Bort was a trifle disconcerted, but didn't show it. "The religion - which the
    Foundation has fostered and encouraged, mind you - is built on on strictly authoritarian lines.
    The priesthood has sole control of the instruments of science we have given Anacreon, but
    they've learned to handle these tools only empirically. They believe in this religion entirely, and
    in the ... uh ... spiritual value of the power they handle. For instance, two months ago some fool
    tampered with the power plant in the Thessalekian Temple - one of the large ones. He
    contaminated the city, of course. It was considered divine vengeance by everyone, including
    the priests."

    "I remember. The papers had some garbled version of the story at the time. I don't see what
    you're driving at."

    "Then, listen," said Bort, stiffly. "The priesthood forms a hierarchy at the apex of which is the
    king, who is regarded as a sort of minor god. He's an absolute monarch by divine right, and the
    people believe it, thoroughly, and the priests, too. You can't overthrow a king like that. Now do
    you get the point?"

    "Hold on," said Walto, at this point. "What did you mean when you said Hardin's done all this?
    How does he come in?"

    Bort glanced at his questioner bitterly. "The Foundation has fostered this delusion assiduously.
    We've put all our scientific backing behind the hoax. There isn't a festival at which the king does
    not preside surrounded by a radioactive aura shining forth all over his body and raising itself
    like a coronet above his head. Anyone touching him is severely burned. He can move from



    place to place through the air at crucial moments, supposedly by inspiration of divine spirit. He
    fills the temple with a pearly, internal light at a gesture. There is no end to these quite simple
    tricks that we perform for his benefit; but even the priests believe them, while working them
    personally."

    "Bad!" said Sermak, biting his lip.

    "I could cry - like the fountain in City Hall Park," said Bort, earnestly, "when I think of the
    chance we muffed. Take the situation thirty years ago, when Hardin saved the Foundation from
    Anacreon - At that time, the Anacreonian people had no real conception of the fact that the
    Empire was running down. They had been more or less running their own affairs since the
    Zeonian revolt, but even after communications broke down and Lepold's pirate of a grandfather
    made himself king, they never quite realized the Empire had gone kaput.

    "If the Emperor had had the nerve to try, he could have taken over again with two cruisers and
    with the help of the internal revolt that would have certainly sprung to life. And we we could
    have done the same; but no, Hardin established monarch worship. Personally, I don't
    understand it. Why? Why? Why?"

    "What," demanded Jaim Orsy, suddenly, "does Verisof do? There was a day when he was an
    advanced Actionist. What's he doing there? Is he blind, too?"

    "I don't know," said Bort, curtly. "He's high priest to them. As far as I know, he does nothing but
    act as adviser to the priesthood on technical details. Figurehead, blast him, figurehead!"

    There was silence all round and all eyes turned to Sermak. The young party leader was biting a
    fingernail nervously, and then said loudly, "No good. It's fishy!"

    He looked around him, and added more energetically, "Is Hardin then such a fool?"

    "Seems to be," shrugged Bort.

    "Never! There's something wrong. To cut our own throats so thoroughly and so hopelessly
    would require colossal stupidity. More than Hardin could possibly have even if he were a fool,
    which I deny. On the one hand, to establish a religion that would wipe out all chance of internal
    troubles. On the other hand, to arm Anacreon with all weapons of warfare. I don't see it."

    "The matter is a little obscure, I admit," said Bort, "but the facts are there. What else can we
    think?"

    Walto said, jerkily, "Outright treason. He's in their pay."

    But Sermak shook his head impatiently. "I don't see that, either. The whole affair is as insane
    and meaningless - Tell me, Bort, have you heard anything about a battle cruiser that the
    Foundation is supposed to have put into shape for use in the Anacreon navy?"

    "Battle cruiser?"

    "An old Imperial cruiser-"

    "No, I haven't. But that doesn't mean much. The navy yards are religious sanctuaries



    completely inviolate on the part of the lay public. No one ever hears anything about the fleet.

    "Well, rumors have leaked out. Some of the Party have brought the matter up in Council.
    Hardin never denied it, you know. His spokesmen denounced rumor mongers and let it go at
    that. It might have significance."

    "It's of a piece with the rest," said Bort. "if true, it's absolutely crazy. But it wouldn't be worse
    than the rest."

    "I suppose," said Orsy, "Hardin hasn't any secret weapon waiting. That might-"

    "Yes," said Sermak, viciously, "a huge jack-in-the-box that will jump out at the psychological
    moment and scare old Wienis into fits. The Foundation may as well blow itself out of existence
    and save itself the agony of suspense if it has to depend on any secret weapon."

    "Well," said Orsy, changing the subject hurriedly, "the question comes down to this: How much
    time have we left? Eli, Bort?"

    "All fight. It is the question. But don't look at me; I don't know. The Anacreonian press never
    mentions the Foundation at all. Right now, it's full of the approaching celebrations and nothing
    else. Lepold is coming of age next week, you know."

    "We have months then." Walto smiled for the first time that evening. "That gives us time-"

    "That gives us time, my foot," ground out Bort, impatiently. "The king's a god, I tell you. Do you
    suppose he has to carry on a campaign of propaganda to get his people into fighting spirit? Do
    you suppose he has to accuse us of aggression and pull out all stops on cheap emotionalism?
    When the time comes to strike, Lepold gives the order and the people fight. Just like that.
    That’s the damnedness of the system. You don’t question a god. He may give the order
    tomorrow for all I know; and you can wrap tobacco round that and smoke it."


    Everyone tried to talk at once and Sermak was slamming the table for silence, when the front
    door opened and Levi Norast stamped in. He bounded up the stairs, overcoat on, trailing snow.


    "Look at that!" he cried, tossing a cold, snow-speckled newspaper onto the table. "The
    visicasters are full of it, too."


    The newspaper was unfolded and five heads bent over it.


    Sermak said, in a hushed voice, "Great Space, he’s going to Anacreon! Going to Anacreon!"


    It is treason," squeaked Tarki, in sudden excitement. "I’ll be damned if Walto isn’t right. He’s



    sold us out and now he’s going there to collect his wage.


    Sermak had risen. "We’ve no choice now. I’m going to ask the Council tomorrow that Hardin be
    impeached. And if that fails-"


    5.

    The snow had ceased, but it caked the ground deeply now and the sleek ground car advanced
    through the deserted streets with lumbering effort. The murky gray light of incipient dawn was
    cold not only in the poetical sense but also in a very literal way - and even in the then turbulent
    state of the Foundation's politics, no one, whether Actionist or pro-Hardin found his spirits
    sufficiently ardent to begin street activity that early.

    Yohan Lee did not like that and his grumblings grew audible. "It's going to look bad, Hardin.
    They're going to say you sneaked away."

    "Let them say it if they wish. I've got to get to Anacreon and I want to do it without trouble. Now
    that's enough, Lee."

    Hardin leaned back into the cushioned seat and shivered slightly. It wasn't cold inside the
    well-heated car, but there was something frigid about a snow-covered world, even through
    glass, that annoyed him.

    He said, reflectively, "Some day when we get around to it we ought to weather-condition
    Terminus. It could be done."

    "I," replied Lee, "would like to see a few other things done first. For instance, what about
    weather-conditioning Sermak? A nice, dry cell fitted for twenty-five centigrade all year round
    would be just fight."

    "And then I'd really need bodyguards," said Hardin, "and not just those two," He indicated two
    of Lee's bully-boys sitting up front with the driver, hard eyes on the empty streets, ready hands
    at their atom blasts. "You evidently want to stir up civil war."

    "I do? There are other sticks in the fire and it won't require much stirring, I can tell you." He
    counted off on blunt fingers, "One: Sermak raised hell yesterday in the City Council and called
    for an impeachment."

    "He had a perfect right to do so," responded Hardin, coolly. "Besides which, his motion was
    defeated 206 to 184."

    "Certainly. A majority of twenty-two when we had counted on sixty as a minimum. Don't deny it;
    you know you did."


    It was close," admitted Hardin.



    "All right. And two; after the vote, the fifty-nine members of the Actionist Party reared upon their
    hind legs and stamped out of the Council Chambers."

    Hardin was silent, and Lee continued, "And three: Before leaving, Sermak howled that you
    were a traitor, that you were going to Anacreon to collect your payment, that the Chamber
    majority in refusing to vote impeachment had participated in the treason, and that the name of
    their party was not 'Actionist' for nothing. What does that sound like?"

    "Trouble, I suppose."

    "And now you're chasing off at daybreak, like a criminal. You ought to face them, Hardin - and
    if you have to, declare martial law, by space!"

    "Violence is the last refuge-"

    "-Of the incompetent. Bah!"

    "All right. We'll see. Now listen to me carefully, Lee. Thirty years ago, the Time Vault opened,
    and on the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of the Foundation, there appeared a Hari Seldon
    recording to give us our first idea of what was really going on."

    "I remember," Lee nodded reminiscently, with a half smile. "It was the day we took over the
    government."

    "That's right. It was the time of our first major crisis. This is our second-and three weeks from
    today will be the eightieth anniversary of the beginning of the Foundation. Does that strike you
    as in any way significant?"

    "You mean he's coming again?"

    "I'm not finished. Seldon never said anything about returning, you understand, but that's of a
    piece with his whole plan. He's always done his best to keep all foreknowledge from us. Nor is
    there any way of telling whether the computer is set for further openings short of dismantling
    the Vault - and it's probably set to destroy itself if we were to try that. I've been there every
    anniversary since the first appearance, just on the chance. He's never shown up, but this is the
    first time since then that there's really been a crisis."

    "Then he'll come."

    "Maybe. I don't know. However, this is the point. At today's session of the Council, just after you
    announce that I have left for Anacreon, you will further announce, officially, that on March 14th
    next, there will be another Hari Seldon recording, containing a message of the utmost
    importance regarding the recent successfully concluded crisis. That's very important, Lee. Don't
    add anything more no matter how many questions are asked."

    Lee stared. "Will they believe it?"

    "That doesn't matter. It will confuse them, which is all I want. Between wondering whether it is
    true and what I mean by it if it isn't - they'll decide to postpone action till after March 1 4th. I'll be
    back considerably before then."



    Lee looked uncertain. "But that 'successfully concluded.' That's bull!"

    "Highly confusing bull. Here's the airport!"

    The waiting spaceship bulked somberly in the dimness. Hardin stamped through the snow
    toward it and at the open air lock turned about with outstretched hand.

    "Good-by, Lee. I hate to leave you in the frying pan like this, but there's not another I can trust.
    Now please keep out of the fire."

    "Don't worry. The frying pan is hot enough. I'll follow orders." He stepped back, and the air lock
    closed.


    6 .


    Salvor Hardin did not travel to the planet Anacreon - from which planet the kingdom derived its
    name - immediately. It was only on the day before the coronation that he arrived, after having
    made flying visits to eight of the larger stellar systems of the kingdom, stopping only long,
    enough to confer with the local representatives of the Foundation.

    The trip left him with an oppressive realization of the vastness of the kingdom. It was a little
    splinter, an insignificant fly speck compared to the inconceivable reaches of the Galactic
    Empire of which it had once formed so distinguished a part; but to one whose habits of thought
    had been built around a single planet, and a sparsely settled one at that, Anacreon's size in
    area and population was staggering.

    Following closely the boundaries of the old Prefect of Anacreon, it embraced twenty-five stellar
    systems, six of which included more than one inhabited world. The population of nineteen
    billion, though still far less than it had been in the Empire's heyday was rising rapidly with the
    increasing scientific development fostered by the Foundation.

    And it was only now that Hardin found himself floored by the magnitude of that task. Even in
    thirty years, only the capital world had been powered. The outer provinces still possessed
    immense stretches where nuclear power had not yet been re-introduced. Even the progress
    that had been made might have been impossible had it not been for the still workable relics left
    over by the ebbing tide of Empire.

    When Hardin did arrive at the capital world, it was to find all normal business at an absolute
    standstill. In the outer provinces there had been and still were celebrations; but here on the
    planet Anacreon, not a person but took feverish part in the hectic religious pageantry that
    heralded the coming-of-age of their god-king, Lepold.

    Hardin had been able to snatch only half an hour from a haggard and harried Verisof before his
    ambassador was forced to rush off to supervise still another temple festival. But the half-hour
    was a most profitable one, and Hardin prepared himself for the night's fireworks well satisfied.

    In all, he acted as an observer, for he had no stomach for the religious tasks he would



    undoubtedly have had to undertake if his identity became known. So, when the palace's
    ballroom filled itself with a glittering horde of the kingdom's very highest and most exalted
    nobility, he found himself hugging the wall, little noticed or totally ignored.

    He had been introduced to Lepold as one of a long line of introducees, and from a safe
    distance, for the king stood apart in lonely and impressive grandeur, surrounded by his deadly
    blaze of radioactive aura. And in less than an hour this same king would take his seat upon the
    massive throne of rhodium-iridium alloy with jewel-set gold chasings, and then, throne and all
    would rise maestically into the air, skim the ground slowly to hover before the great window
    from which the great crowds of common folk could see their king and shout themselves into
    near apoplexy. The throne would not have been so massive, of course, if it had not had a
    shielded nuclear motor built into it.

    It was past eleven. Hardin fidgeted and stood on his toes to better his view. He resisted an
    impulse to stand on a chair. And then he saw Wienis threading through the crowd toward him
    and he relaxed.

    Wienis' progress was slow. At almost every step, he had to pass a kindly sentence with some
    revered noble whose grandfather had helped Lepold's grandfather brigandize the kingdom and
    had received a dukedom therefor.

    And then he disentangled himself from the last uniformed peer and reached Hardin. His smile
    crooked itself into a smirk and his black eyes peered from under grizzled brows with glints of
    satisfaction in them.

    "My dear Hardin," he said, in a low voice, "you must expect to be bored, when you refuse to
    announce your identity."

    "I am not bored, your highness. This is all extremely interesting. We have no comparable
    spectacles on Terminus, you know."

    "No doubt. But would you care to step into my private chambers, where we can speak at
    greater length and with considerably more privacy?"

    "Certainly."

    With arms linked, the two ascended the staircase, and more than one dowager duchess stared
    after them in surprise and wondered at the identity of this insignificantly dressed and
    uninteresting-looking stranger on whom such signal honor was being conferred by the prince
    regent.

    In Wienis' chambers, Hardin relaxed in perfect comfort and accepted with a murmur of gratitude
    the glass of liquor that had been poured out by the regent's own hand.

    "Locris wine, Hardin," said Wienis, "from the royal cellars. The real thing - two centuries in age.
    It was laid down ten years before the Zeonian Rebellion."

    "A really royal drink," agreed Hardin, politely. "To Lepold I, King of Anacreon."

    They drank, and Wienis added blandly, at the pause, "And soon to be Emperor of the



    Periphery, and further, who knows? The Galaxy may some day be reunited."

    "Undoubtedly. By Anacreon?"

    "Why not? With the help of the Foundation, our scientific superiority over the rest of the
    Periphery would be undisputable."

    Hardin set his empty glass down and said, "Well, yes, except that, of course, the Foundation is
    bound to help any nation that requests scientific aid of it. Due to the high idealism of our
    government and the great moral purpose of our founder, Hari Seldon, we are unable to play
    favorites. That can't be helped, your highness."

    Wienis' smile broadened. "The Galactic Spirit, to use the popular cant, helps those who help
    themselves. I quite understand that, left to itself, the Foundation would never cooperate."

    "I wouldn't say that. We repaired the Imperial cruiser for you, though my board of navigation
    wished it for themselves for research purposes."

    The regent repeated the last words ironically. "Research purposes! Yes! Yet you would not
    have repaired it, had I not threatened war."

    Hardin made a deprecatory gesture. "I don't know."

    "I do. And that threat always stood."

    "And still stands now?"

    "Now it is rather too late to speak of threats." Wienis had cast a rapid glance at the clock on his
    desk. "Look here, Hardin, you were on Anacreon once before. You were young then; we were
    both young. But even then we had entirely different ways of looking at things. You're what they
    call a man of peace, aren't you?"

    "I suppose I am. At least, I consider violence an uneconomical way of attaining an end. There
    are always better substitutes, though they may sometimes be a little less direct."

    "Yes. I've heard of your famous remark: 'Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' And
    yet" - the regent scratched one ear gently in affected abstraction -"I wouldn't call myself
    exactly incompetent."

    Hardin nodded politely and said nothing.

    "And in spite of that," Wienis continued, "I have always believed in direct action. I have believed
    in carving a straight path to my objective and following that path. I have accomplished much
    that way, and fully expect to accomplish still more."

    "I know," interrupted Hardin. "I believe you are carving a path such as you describe for yourself
    and your children that leads directly to the throne, considering the late unfortunate death of the
    king's father - your elder brother and the king's own precarious state of health. He is in a
    precarious state of health, is he not?"

    Wienis frowned at the shot, and his voice grew harder. "You might find it advisable, Hardin, to
    avoid certain subjects. You may consider yourself privileged as mayor of Terminus to make ...



    uh ... injudicious remarks, but if you do, please disabuse yourself of the notion. I am not one to
    be frightened at words. It has been my philosophy of life that difficulties vanish when faced
    boldly, and I have never turned my back upon one yet."

    "I don't doubt that. What particular difficulty are you refusing to turn your back upon at the
    present moment?"

    "The difficulty, Hardin, of persuading the Foundation to co-operate. Your policy of peace, you
    see, has led you into making several very serious mistakes, simply because you
    underestimated the boldness of your adversary. Not everyone is as afraid of direct action as
    you are."

    "For instance?" suggested Hardin.

    "For instance, you came to Anacreon alone and accompanied me to my chambers alone."
    Hardin looked about him. "And what is wrong with that?"

    "Nothing," said the regent, "except that outside this room are five police guards, well armed and
    ready to shoot. I don't think you can leave, Hardin."

    The mayor's eyebrows lifted, "I have no immediate desire to leave. Do you then fear me so
    much?"

    "I don't fear you at all. But this may serve to impress you with my determination. Shall we call it
    a gesture?"

    "Call it what you please," said Hardin, indifferently. "I shall not discommode myself over the
    incident, whatever you choose to call it."

    "I'm sure that attitude will change with time. But you have made another error, Hardin, a more
    serious one. It seems that the planet Terminus is almost wholly undefended."

    "Naturally. What have we to fear? We threaten no one's interest and serve all alike."

    "And while remaining helpless," Wienis went on, "you kindly helped us to arm ourselves, aiding
    us particularly in the development of a navy of our own, a great navy. In fact, a navy which,
    since your donation of the Imperial cruiser, is quite irresistible."

    "Your highness, you are wasting time." Hardin made as if to rise from his seat. "If you mean to
    declare war, and are informing me of the fact, you will allow me to communicate with my
    government at once."

    "Sit down, Hardin. I am not declaring war, and you are not communicating with your
    government at all. When the war is fought - not declared, Hardin, fought - the Foundation will
    be informed of it in due time by the nuclear blasts of the Anacreonian navy under the lead of my
    own son upon the flagship, Wienis, once a cruiser of the Imperial navy."

    Hardin frowned. "When will all this happen?"

    "If you're really interested, the ships of the fleet left Anacreon exactly fifty minutes ago, at



    eleven, and the first shot will be fired as soon as they sight Terminus, which should be at noon
    tomorrow. You may consider yourself a prisoner of war."

    "That's exactly what I do consider myself, your highness," said Hardin, still frowning. "But I'm
    disappointed."

    Wienis chuckled contemptuously. "Is that all?"

    "Yes. I had thought that the moment of coronation - midnight, you know - would be the logical
    time to set the fleet in motion. Evidently, you wanted to start the war while you were still regent.
    It would have been more dramatic the other way."

    The regent stared. "What in Space are you talking about?"

    "Don't you understand?" said Hardin, softly. "I had set my counterstroke for midnight."

    Wienis started from his chair. "You are not bluffing me. There is no counterstroke. If you are
    counting on the support of the other kingdoms, forget it. Their navies, combined, are no match
    for ours."

    "I know that. I don't intend firing a shot. It is simply that the word went out a week ago that at
    midnight tonight, the planet Anacreon goes under the interdict."

    "The interdict?"

    "Yes. If you don't understand, I might explain that every priest in Anacreon is going on strike,
    unless I countermand the order. But I can't while I'm being held incommunicado; nor do I wish
    to even if I weren't!" He leaned forward and added, with sudden animation, "Do you realize,
    your highness, that an attack on the Foundation is nothing short of sacrilege of the highest
    order?"

    Wienis was groping visibly for self-control. "Give me none of that, Hardin. Save it for the mob."

    "My dear Wienis, whoever do you think I am saving it for? I imagine that for the last half hour
    every temple on Anacreon has been the center of a mob listening to a priest exhorting them
    upon that very subject. There's not a man or woman on Anacreon that doesn't know that their
    government has launched a vicious, unprovoked attack upon the center of their religion. But it
    lacks only four minutes of midnight now. You'd better go down to the ballroom to watch events.
    I'll be safe here with five guards outside the door." He leaned back in his chair, helped himself
    to another glass of Locris wine, and gazed at the ceiling with perfect indifference.

    Wienis suddenly furious, rushed out of the room.

    A hush had fallen over the elite in the ballroom, as a broad path was cleared for the throne.
    Lepold sat on it now, hands solidly on its arms, head high, face frozen. The huge chandeliers
    had dimmed and in the diffused multi-colored light from the tiny nucleo-bulbs that bespangled
    the vaulted ceiling, the royal aura shone out bravely, lifting high above his head to form a
    blazing coronet.

    Wienis paused on the stairway. No one saw him; all eyes were on the throne. He clenched his
    fists and remained where he was; Hardin would not bluff him into action.



    And then the throne stiffed. Noiselessly, it lifted upward - and drifted. Off the dais, slowly down
    the steps, and then horizontally, five centimetres off the floor, it worked itself toward the huge,
    open window.

    At the sound of the deep-toned bell that signified midnight, it stopped before the window - and
    the king's aura died.

    For a frozen split second, the king did not move, face twisted in surprise, without an aura,
    merely human; and then the throne wobbled and dropped to the floor with a crashing thump,
    just as every light in the palace went out.

    Through the shrieking din and confusion, Wienis' bull voice sounded. "Get the flares! Get the
    flares!"

    He buffeted right and left through the crowd and forced his way to the door. From without,
    palace guards had streamed into the darkness.

    Somehow the flares were brought back to the ballroom; flares that were to have been used in
    the gigantic torchlight procession through the streets of the city after the coronation.

    Back to the ballroom guardsmen swarmed with torches - blue, green, and red; where the
    strange light lit up frightened, confused faces.

    "There is no harm done," shouted Wienis. "Keep your places. Power will return in a moment."
    He turned to the captain of the guard who stood stiffly at attention. "What is it, Captain?"

    "Your highness," was the instant response, "the palace is surrounded by the people of the city."
    "What do they want?" snarled Wienis.

    "A priest is at the head. He has been identified as High Priest Poly Verisof. He demands the
    immediate release of Mayor Salvor Hardin and cessation of the war against the Foundation."
    The report was made in the expressionless tones of an officer, but his eyes shifted uneasily.

    Wienis cried, "if any of the rabble attempt to pass the palace gates, blast them out of existence.
    For the moment, nothing more. Let them howl! There will be an accounting tomorrow."

    The torches had been distributed now, and the ballroom was again alight. Wienis rushed to the
    throne, still standing by the window, and dragged the stricken, wax-faced Lepold to his feet.

    "Come with me." He cast one look out of the window. The city was pitch-black. From below
    there were the hoarse confused cries of the mob. Only toward the fight, where the Argolid
    Temple stood was there illumination. He swore angrily, and dragged the king away.

    Wienis burst into his chambers, the five guardsmen at his heels. Lepold followed, wide-eyed,
    scared speechless.

    "Hardin," said Wienis, huskily, "you are playing with forces too great for you."

    The mayor ignored the speaker. In the pearly light of the pocket nucleo-bulb at his side, he



    remained quietly seated, a slightly ironic smile on his face.

    "Good morning, your majesty," he said to Lepold. "I congratulate you on your coronation."
    "Hardin," cried Wienis again, "order your priests back to their jobs."

    Hardin looked up coolly. "Order them yourself, Wienis, and see who is playing with forces too
    great for whom. Right now, there's not a wheel turning in Anacreon. There's not a light burning,
    except in the temples. There's not a drop of water running, except in the temples. On the wintry
    half of the planet, there's not a calorie of heat, except in the temples. The hospitals are taking in
    no more patients. The power plants have shut down. All ships are grounded. If you don't like it,
    Wienis, you can order the priests back to their jobs. I don't wish to."

    "By Space, Hardin, I will. If it's to be a showdown, so be it. We'll see if your priests can
    withstand the army. Tonight, every temple on the planet will be put under army supervision."

    "Very good, but how are you going to give the orders? Every line of communication on the
    planet is shut down. You'll find that neither wave nor hyperwave will work. In fact, the only
    communicator of the planet that will work - outside of the temples, of course - is the televisor
    right here in this room, and I've fitted it only for reception."

    Wienis struggled vainly for breath, and Hardin continued, "If you wish you can order your army
    into the Argolid Temple just outside the palace and then use the ultrawave sets there to contact
    other portions of the planet. But if you do that, I'm afraid the army contigent will be cut to pieces
    by the mob, and then what will protect your palace, Wienis? And your lives, Wienis?"

    Wienis said thickly, "We can hold out, devil. We'll last the day. Let the mob howl and let the
    power die, but we'll hold out. And when the news comes back that the Foundation has been
    taken, your precious mob will find upon what vacuum their religion has been built, and they'll
    desert your priests and turn against them. I give you until noon tomorrow, Hardin, because you
    can stop the power on Anacreon but you can't stop my fleet. " His voice croaked exultantly.
    "They're on their way, Hardin, with the great cruiser you yourself ordered repaired, at the head."

    Hardin replied lightly. "Yes, the cruiser I myself ordered repaired - but in my own way. Tell me,
    Wienis, have you ever heard of a hyperwave relay? No, I see you haven't. Well, in about two
    minutes you'll find out what one can do."

    The televisor flashed to life as he spoke, and he amended, "No, in two seconds. Sit down,
    Wienis. and listen."


    7 .

    Theo Aporat was one of the very highest ranking priests of Anacreon. From the standpoint of
    precedence alone, he deserved his appointment as head priest- attendant upon the flagship
    Wienis.


    But it was not only rank or precedence. He knew the ship. He had worked directly under the
    holy men from the Foundation itself in repairing the ship. He had gone over the motors under



    their orders. He had rewired the 'visors; revamped the communications system; replated the
    punctured hull; reinforced the beams. He had even been permitted to help while the wise men
    of the Foundation had installed a device so holy it had never been placed in any previous ship,
    but had been reserved only for this magnificent colossus of a vessel - a hyperwave relay.

    It was no wonder that he felt heartsick over the purposes to which the glorious ship was
    perverted. He had never wanted to believe what Verisof had told him - that the ship was to be
    used for appalling wickedness; that its guns were to be turned on the great Foundation. Turned
    on that Foundation, where he had been trained as a youth, from which all blessedness was
    derived.

    Yet he could not doubt now, after what the admiral had told him.

    How could the king, divinely blessed, allow this abominable act? Or was it the king? Was it not,
    perhaps, an action of the accursed regent, Wienis, without the knowledge of the king at all. And
    it was the son of this same Wienis that was the admiral who five minutes before had told him:

    "Attend to your souls and your blessings, priest. I will attend to my ship."

    Aporat smiled crookedly. He would attend to his souls and his blessings - and also to his
    cursings; and Prince Lefkin would whine soon enough.

    He had entered the general communications room now. His. acolyte preceded him and the two
    officers in charge made no move to interfere. The head priest-attendant had the right of free
    entry anywhere on the ship.

    "Close the door," Aporat ordered, and looked at the chronometer. It lacked Five minutes of
    twelve. He had timed it well.

    With quick practiced motions, he moved the little levers that opened all communications, so that
    every part of the two-mile-long ship was within reach of his voice and his image.

    "Soldiers of the royal flagship Wienis, attend! It is your priest-attendant that speaks!" The sound
    of his voice reverberated, he knew, from the stem atom blast in the extreme rear to the
    navigation tables in the prow.

    "Your ship," he cried, "is engaged in sacrilege. Without your knowledge, it is performing such
    an act as will doom the soul of every man among you to the eternal frigidity of space! Listen! It
    is the intention of your commander to take this ship to the Foundation and there to bombard
    that source of all blessings into submission to his sinful will. And since that is his intention, I, in
    the name of the Galactic Spirit, remove him from his command, for there is no command where
    the blessing of the Galactic Spirit has been withdrawn. The divine king himself may not
    maintain his kingship without the consent of the Spirit."

    His voice took on a deeper tone, while the acolyte listened with veneration and the two soldiers
    with mounting fear. "And because this ship is upon such a devil's errand, the blessing of the
    Spirit is removed from it as well."

    He lifted his arms solemnly, and before a thousand televisors throughout the ship, soldiers
    cowered, as the stately image of their priest-attendant spoke:



    "In the name of the Galactic Spirit and of his prophet, Hari Seldon, and of his interpreters, the
    holy men of the Foundation, I curse this ship. Let the televisors of this ship, which are its eyes,
    become blind. Let its grapples, which are its arms, be paralyzed. Let the nuclear blasts, which
    are its fists, lose their function. Let the motors, which are its heart, cease to beat. Let the
    communications, which are its voice, become dumb. Let its ventilations, which are its breath,
    fade. Let its lights, which are its soul, shrivel into nothing. In the name of the Galactic Spirit, I so
    curse this ship."

    And with his last word, at the stroke of midnight, a hand, light-years distant in the Argolid
    Temple, opened an ultrawave relay, which at the instantaneous speed of the ultrawave, opened
    another on the flagship Wienis.

    And the ship died!

    For it is the chief characteristic of the religion of science that it works, and that such curses as
    that of Aporat's are really deadly.

    Aporat saw the darkness close down on the ship and heard the sudden ceasing of the soft,
    distant purring of the hyperatomic motors. Fie exulted and from the pocket of his long robe
    withdrew a self-powered nucleo-bulb that filled the room with pearly light.

    Fie looked down at the two soldiers who, brave men though they undoubtedly were, writhed on
    their knees in the last extremity of mortal terror. "Save our souls, your reverence. We are poor
    men, ignorant of the crimes of our leaders," one whimpered.

    "Follow," said Aporat, sternly. "Your soul is not yet lost."

    The ship was a turmoil of darkness in which fear was so thick and palpable, it was all but a
    miasmic smell. Soldiers crowded close wherever Aporat and his circle of light passed, striving
    to touch the hem of his robe, pleading for the tiniest scrap of mercy.

    And always his answer was, "Follow me!"

    Fie found Prince Lefkin, groping his way through the officers' quarters, cursing loudly for lights.
    The admiral stared at the priest-attendant with hating eyes.

    "There you are!" Lefkin inherited his blue eyes from his mother, but there was that about the
    hook in his nose and the squint in his eye that marked him as the son of Wienis. "What is the
    meaning of your treasonable actions? Return the power to the ship. I am commander here."

    "No longer," said Aporat, somberly.

    Lefkin looked about wildly. "Seize that man. Arrest him, or by Space, I will send every man
    within reach of my voice out the air lock in the nude." Fie paused, and then shrieked, "It is your
    admiral that orders. Arrest him."

    Then, as he lost his head entirely, "Are you allowing yourselves to be fooled by this
    mountebank, this harlequin? Do you cringe before a religion compounded of clouds and
    moonbeams? This man is an imposter and the Galactic Spirit he speaks of a fraud of the
    imagination devised to-"



    Aporat interrupted furiously. "Seize the blasphemer. You listen to him at the peril of your souls."
    And promptly, the noble admiral went down under the clutching hands of a score of soldiers.
    "Take him with you and follow me."

    Aporat turned, and with Lefkin dragged along after him, and the corridors behind black with
    soldiery, he returned to the communications room. There, he ordered the ex-commander before
    the one televisor that worked.

    "Order the rest of the fleet to cease course and to prepare for the return to Anacreon."

    The disheveled Lefkin, bleeding, beaten, and half stunned, did so.

    "And now," continued Aporat, grimly, "we are in contact with Anacreon on the hyperwave beam.
    Speak as I order you."

    Lefkin made a gesture of negation, and the mob in the room and the others crowding the
    corridor beyond, growled fearfully.

    "Speak!" said Aporat. "Begin: The Anacreonian navy-"

    Lefkin began.


    8 .

    There was absolute silence in Wienis' chambers when the image of Prince Lefkin appeared at
    the televisor. There had been one startled gasp from the regent at the haggard face and
    shredded uniform of his son, and then he collapsed into a chair, face contorted with surprise
    and apprehension.

    Hardin listened stolidly, hands clasped lightly in his lap, while the just-crowned King Lepold sat
    shriveled in the most shadowy comer, biting spasmodically at his goldbraided sleeve. Even the
    soldiers had lost the emotionless stare that is the prerogative of the military, and, from where
    they lined up against the door, nuclear blasts ready, peered furtively at the figure upon the
    televisor.

    Lefkin spoke, reluctantly, with a tired voice that paused at intervals as though he were being
    prompted-and not gently:

    "The Anacreonian navy ... aware of the nature of its mission ... and refusing to be a party ... to
    abominable sacrilage ... is returning to Anacreon ... with the following ultimatum issued ... to
    those blaspheming sinners ... who would dare to use profane force ... against the Foundation ...
    source of all blessings ... and against the Galactic Spirit. Cease at once all war against ... the
    true faith . . . and guarantee in a manner suiting us of the navy ... as represented by our ...
    priest-attendant, Theo Aporat ... that such war will never in the future ... be resumed, and that"-
    here a long pause, and then continuing -"and that the one-time prince regent, Wienis ... be
    imprisoned ... and tried before an ecclesiastical court ... for his crimes. Otherwise the royal navy
    ... upon returning to Anacreon ... will blast the palace to the ground ... and take whatever other



    measures ... are


    necessary ... to destroy the nest of sinners ... and the den of destroyers ... of men's souls that
    now prevail."

    The voice ended with half a sob and the screen went blank.

    Hardin's fingers passed rapidly over the nucleo-bulb and its light faded until in the dimness, the
    hitherto regent, the king, and the soldiers were hazy-edged shadows; and for the first time it
    could be seen that an aura encompassed Hardin.

    It was not the blazing light that was the prerogative of kings, but one less spectacular, less
    impressive, and yet one more effective in its own way, and more useful.

    Hardin's voice was softly ironic as he addressed the same Wienis who had one hour earlier
    declared him a prisoner of war and Terminus on the point of destruction, and who now was a
    huddled shadow, broken and silent.

    "There is an old fable," said Hardin, "as old perhaps as humanity, for the oldest records
    containing it are merely copies of other records still older, that might interest you. It runs as
    follows:

    "A horse having a wolf as a powerful and dangerous enemy lived in constant fear of his life.
    Being driven to desperation, it occured to him to seek a strong ally. Whereupon he approached
    a man, and offered an alliance, pointing out that the wolf was likewise an enemy of the man.
    The man accepted the partnership at once and offered to kill the wolf immediately, if his new
    partner would only co-operate by placing his greater speed at the man's disposal. The horse
    was willing, and allowed the man to place bridle and saddle upon him. The man mounted,
    hunted down the wolf, and killed him.

    "The horse, joyful and relieved, thanked the man, and said: 'Now that our enemy is dead,
    remove your bridle and saddle and restore my freedom.'

    "Whereupon the man laughed loudly and replied, 'Never!' and applied the spurs with a will."
    Silence still. The shadow that was Wienis did not stir.

    Hardin continued quietly, "You see the analogy, I hope. In their anxiety to cement forever
    domination over their own people, the kings of the Four Kingdoms accepted the religion of
    science that made them divine; and that same religion of science was their bridle and saddle,
    for it placed the life blood of nuclear power in the hands of the priesthoodwho took their orders
    from us, be it noted, and not from you. You killed the wolf, but could not get rid of the m-"

    Wienis sprang to his feet and in the shadows, his eyes were maddened hollows. His voice was
    thick, incoherent. "And yet I'll get you. You won't escape. You'll rot. Let them blow us up. Let
    them blow everything up. You'll rot! I'll get you!

    "Soldiers!" he thundered, hysterically. "Shoot me down that devil. Blast him! Blast him!"

    Hardin turned about in his chair to face the soldiers and smiled. One aimed his nuclear blast
    and then lowered it. The others never budged. Salvor Hardin, mayor of Terminus, surrounded



    by that soft aura, smiling so confidently, and before whom all the power of Anacreon had
    crumbled to powder was too much for them, despite the orders of the shrieking maniac just
    beyond.

    Wienis shouted incoherently and staggered to the nearest soldier. Wildly, he wrested the
    nuclear blast from the man's hand-aimed it at Hardin, who didn't stir, shoved the lever and held
    it contacted.

    The pale continous beam impinged upon the force-field that surrounded the mayor of Terminus
    and was sucked harmlessly to neutralization. Wienis pressed harder and laughed tearingly.

    Hardin still smiled and his force-field aura scarcely brightened as it absorbed the energies of
    the nuclear blast. From his comer Lepold covered his eyes and moaned.

    And, with a yell of despair, Wienis changed his aim and shot again - and toppled to the floor
    with his head blown into nothingness.

    Hardin winced at the sight and muttered, "A man of 'direct action' to the end. The last refuge!"


    9 .

    The Time Vault was filled; filled far beyond the available seating capacity, and men lined the
    back of the room, three deep.

    Salvor Hardin compared this large company with the few men attending the first appearance of
    Hari Seldon, thirty years earlier. There had only been six, then; the five old Encyclopedists - all
    dead now - and himself, the young figurehead of a mayor. It had been on that day, that he, with
    Yohan Lee's assistance had removed the "figurehead" stigma from his office.

    It was quite different now; different in every respect. Every man of the City Council was
    awaiting Seldon's appearance. He, himself, was still mayor, but all-powerful now; and since the
    utter rout of Anacreon, all-popular. When he had returned from Anacreon with the news of the
    death of Wienis, and the new treaty signed with the trembling Lepold, he was greeted with a
    vote of confidence of shrieking unanimity. When this was followed in rapid order, by similar
    treaties signed with each of the other three kingdoms - treaties that gave the Foundation
    powers such as would forever prevent any attempts at attack similar to that of Anacreon's -
    torchlight processions had been held in every city street of Terminus. Not even Hari Seldon's
    name had been more loudly cheered.

    Hardin's lips twitched. Such popularity had been his after the first crisis also.

    Across the room, Sef Sermak and Lewis Bort were engaged in animated discussion, and recent
    events seemed to have put them out not at all. They had joined in the vote of confidence; made
    speeches in which they publicly admitted that they had been in the wrong, apologized
    handsomely for the use of certain phrases in earlier debates, excused themselves delicately by
    declaring they had merely followed the dictates of their judgement and their conscience - and
    immediately launched a new Actionist campaign.



    Yohan Lee touched Hardin's sleeve and pointed significantly to his watch.

    Hardin looked up. "Hello there, Lee. Are you still sour? What's wrong now?"

    "He's due in five minutes, isn't he?"

    "I presume so. He appeared at noon last time."

    "What if he doesn't?"

    "Are you going to wear me down with your worries all your life? If he doesn't, he won't."

    Lee frowned and shook his head slowly. "If this thing flops, we're in another mess. Without
    Seldon's backing for what we've done, Sermak will be free to start all over. He wants outright
    annexation of the Four Kingdoms, and immediate expansion of the Foundation - by force, if
    necessary. He's begun his campaign, already."

    "I know. A fire eater must eat fire even if he has to kindle it himself. And you, Lee, have got to
    worry even if you must kill yourself to invent something to worry about."

    Lee would have answered, but he lost his breath at just that moment - as the lights yellowed
    and went dim. He raised his arm to point to the glass cubicle that dominated half the room and
    then collapsed into a chair with a windy sigh.

    Hardin himself straightened at the sight of the figure that now filled the cubicle - a figure in a
    wheel chair! He alone, of all those present could remember the day, decades ago, when that
    figure had appeared first. He had been young then, and the figure old. Since then, the figure
    had not aged a day, but he himself had in turn grown old.

    The figure stared straight ahead, hands fingering a book in its lap.

    It said, "I am Hari Seldon!" The voice was old and soft.

    There was a breathless silence in the room and Hari Seldon continued conversationally, "This
    is the second time I've been here. Of course, I don't know if any of you were here the first time.
    In fact, I have no way of telling, by sense perception, that there is anyone here at all, but that
    doesn't matter. If the second crisis has been overcome safely, you are bound to be here; there
    is no way out. If you are not here, then the second crisis has been too much for you."

    He smiled engagingly. "I doubt that, however, for my figures show a ninety-eight point four
    percent probability there is to be no significant deviation from the Plan in the first eighty years.

    "According to our calculations, you have now reached domination of the barbarian kingdoms
    immediately surrounding the Foundation. Just as in the first crisis you held them off by use of
    the Balance of Power, so in the second, you gained mastery by use of the Spiritual Power as
    against the Temporal.

    "However, I might warn you here against overconfidence. It is not my way to grant you any
    foreknowledge in these recordings, but it would be safe to indicate that what you have now
    achieved is merely a new balance-though one in which your position is considerably better. The
    Spiritual Power, while sufficient to ward off attacks of the Temporal is not sufficient to attack in



    turn. Because of the invariable growth of the counteracting force known as Regionalism, or
    Nationalism, the Spiritual Power cannot prevail. I am telling you nothing new, I'm sure.

    "You must pardon me, by the way, for speaking to you in this vague way. The terms I use are at
    best mere approximations, but none of you is qualified to understand the true symbology of
    psychohistory, and so I must do the best I can.

    "In this case, the Foundation is only at the start of the path that leads to the Second Galactic
    Empire. The neighboring kingdoms, in manpower and resources are still overwhelmingly
    powerful as compared to yourselves. Outside them lies the vast tangled jungle of barbarism
    that extends around the entire breadth of the Galaxy. Within that rim there is still what is left of
    the Galactic Empire - and that, weakened and decaying though it is, is still incomparably
    mighty."

    At this point, Hari Seldon lifted his book and opened it. His face grew solemn. "And never forget
    there was another Foundation established eighty years ago; a Foundation at the other end of
    the Galaxy, at Star's End. They will always be there for consideration. Gentlemen, nine hundred
    and twenty years of the Plan stretch ahead of you. The problem is yours!"

    He dropped his eyes to his book and flicked out of existence, while the lights brightened to
    fullness. In the babble that followed, Lee leaned over to Hardin's ear. "He didn't say when he'd
    be back."

    Hardin replied, "I know - but I trust he won't return until you and I are safely and cozily dead!"


    PART IV

    THE TRADERS

    i.

    TRADERS-... and constantly in advance of the political hegemony of the Foundation were the
    Traders, reaching out tenuous fingerholds through the tremendous distances of the Periphery.
    Months or years might pass between landings on Terminus; their ships were often nothing
    more than patchquilts of home-made repairs and improvisations; their honesty was none of the
    highest; their daring...

    Through it all they forged an empire more enduring than the pseudo-religious despotism of the
    Four Kingdoms...


    Tales without end are told of these massive, lonely figures who bore half-seriously,
    half-mockingly a motto adopted from one of Salvor Hardin's epigrams, "Never let your sense of




    morals prevent you from doing what is right!" It is difficult now to tell which tales are real and
    which apocryphal. There are none probably that have not suffered some exaggeration....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Limmar Ponyets was completely a-lather when the call reached his receiver - which proves
    that the old bromide about telemessages and the shower holds true even in the dark, hard
    space of the Galactic Periphery.

    Luckily that part of a free-lance trade ship which is not given over to miscellaneous
    merchandise is extremely snug. So much so, that the shower, hot water included, is located in
    a two-by-four cubby, ten feet from the control panels. Ponyets heard the staccato rattle of the
    receiver quite plainly.

    Dripping suds and a growl, he stepped out to adjust the vocal, and three hours later a second
    trade ship was alongside, and a grinning youngster entered through the air tube between the
    ships.

    Ponyets rattled his best chair forward and perched himself on the pilot-swivel.

    "What've you been doing, Gorm?" he asked, darkly. "Chasing me all the way from the
    Foundation?"

    Les Gorm broke out a cigarette, and shook his head definitely, "Me? Not a chance. I'm just a
    sucker who happened to land on Glyptal IV the day after the mail. So they sent me out after
    you with this."

    The tiny, gleaming sphere changed hands, and Gorm added, "It's confidential. Super-secret.
    Can't be trusted to the sub-ether and all that. Or so I gather. At least, it's a Personal Capsule,
    and won't open for anyone but you."

    Ponyets regarded the capsule distastefully, "I can see that. And I never knew one of these to
    hold good news, either."

    It opened in his hand and the thin, transparent tape unrolled stiffly. His eyes swept the
    message quickly, for when the last of the tape had emerged, the first was already brown and
    crinkled. In a minute and a half it had turned black and, molecule by molecule, fallen apart.

    Ponyets grunted hollowly, "Oh, Galaxy f

    Les Gorm said quietly, "Can I help somehow? Or is it too secret?"

    "It will bear telling, since you're of the Guild. I've got to go to Askone."

    "That place? How come?"

    "They've imprisoned a trader. But keep it to yourself."

    Gorm's expression jolted into anger, "Imprisoned! That's against the Convention."

    "So is the interference with local politics."



    "Oh! Is that what he did?" Gorm meditated. "Who's the trader'? Anyone I know?"

    "No!" said Ponyets sharply, and Gorm accepted the implication and asked no further questions.

    Ponyets was up and staring darkly out the visiplate. He mumbled strong expressions at that
    part of the misty lens-form that was the body of the Galaxy, then said loudly, "Damnedest
    mess! I'm way behind quota."

    Light broke on Gorm's intellect, "Hey, friend, Askone is a closed area."

    "That's right. You can't sell as much as a penknife on Askone. They won't buy nuclear gadgets
    of any sort. With my quota dead on its feet, it's murder to go there."

    "Can't get out of it?"

    Ponyets shook his head absently, A know the fellow involved. Can't walk out on a friend. What
    of it? I am in the hands of the Galactic Spirit and walk cheerfully in the way he points out."

    Gorm said blankly, "Huh?"

    Ponyets looked at him, and laughed shortly, "I forgot. You never read the 'Bood of the Spirit,'
    did you?"

    "Never heard of it," said Gorm, curtly.

    "Well, you would if you'd had a religious training."

    "Religious training? For the priesthood?" Gorm was profoundly shocked.

    "Afraid so. It's my dark shame and secret. I was too much for the Reverend Fathers, though,
    They expelled me, for reasons sufficient to promote me to a secular education under the
    Foundation. Well, look, I'd better push off. How's your quota this year?"

    Gorm crushed out his cigarette and adjusted his cap, "I've got my last cargo going now. I'll
    make it."

    "Lucky fellow," gloomed Ponyets, and for many minutes after Les Gorm left, he sat in
    motionless reverie.

    So Eskel Gorov was on Askone - and in prison as well!

    That was bad! In fact, considerably worse than it might appear. It was one thing to tell a curious
    youngster a diluted version of the business to throw him off and send him about his own. It was
    a thing of a different sort to face the truth.

    For Limmar Ponyets was one of the few people who happened to know that Master Trader
    Eskel Gorov was not a trader at all; but that entirely different thing, an agent of the Foundation!


    2 .

    Two weeks gone! Two weeks wasted.



    One week to reach Askone, at the extreme borders of which the vigilant warships speared out
    to meet him in converging numbers. Whatever their detection system was, it worked - and well.


    They sidled him in slowly, without a signal, maintaining their cold distance, and pointing him
    harshly towards the central sun of Askone.

    Ponyets could have handled them at a pinch. Those ships were holdovers from the
    dead-and-gone Galactic Empire - but they were sports cruisers, not warships; and without
    nuclear weapons, they were so many picturesque and impotent ellipsoids. But Eskel Gorov was
    a prisoner in their hands, and Gorov was not a hostage to lose. The Askonians must know that.

    And then another week - a week to wind a weary way through the clouds of minor officials that
    formed the buffer between the Grand Master and the outer world. Each little sub-secretary
    required soothing and conciliation. Each required careful and nauseating milking for the
    flourishing signature that was the pathway to the next official one higher up.

    For the first time, Ponyets found his trader's identification papers useless.

    I Now, at last, the Grand Master was on the other side of the Guard-flanked gilded door - and
    two weeks had gone.

    Gorov was still a prisoner and Ponyets' cargo rotted useless in the holds of his ship.

    The Grand Master was a small man; a small man with a balding head and very wrinkled face,
    whose body seemed weighed down to motionlessness by the huge, glossy fur collar about his
    neck.

    His fingers moved on either side, and the line of armed men backed away to for a passage,
    along which Ponyets strode to the foot of the Chair of State.

    "Don't speak," snapped the Grand Master, and Ponyets' opening lips closed tightly.

    "That's right," the Askonian ruler relaxed visibly, "I can't endure useless chatter. You cannot
    threaten and I won't abide flattery. Nor is there room for injured complaints. I have lost count of
    the times you wanderers have been warned that your devil's machines are not wanted
    anywhere in Askone."

    "Sir," said Ponyets, quietly, "there is no attempt to justify the trader in question. It is not the
    policy of traders to intrude where they are not wanted. But the Galaxy is great, and it has
    happened before that a boundary has been trespassed unwittingly. It was a deplorable
    mistake."

    "Deplorable, certainly," squeaked the Grand Master. "But mistake? Your people on Glyptal IV
    have been bombarding me with pleas for negotiation since two hours after the sacrilegious
    wretch was seized. I have been warned by them of your own coming many times over. It seems
    a well-organized rescue campaign. Much seems to have been anticipated - a little too much for



    mistakes, deplorable or otherwise."

    The Askonian's black eyes were scornful. He raced on, "And are you traders, flitting from world
    to world like mad little butterflies, so mad in your own right that you can land on Askone's
    largest world, in the center of its system, and consider it an unwitting boundary mixup? Come,
    surely not."

    Ponyets winced without showing it. He said, doggedly, "If the attempt to trade was deliberate,
    your Veneration, it was most injudicious and contrary to the strictest regulations of our Guild."

    "Injudicious, yes," said the Askonian, curtly. "So much so, that your comrade is likely to lose life
    in payment."

    Ponyets' stomach knotted. There was no irresolution there. He said, "Death, your Veneration, is
    so absolute and irrevocable a phenomenon that certainly there must be some alternative."

    There was a pause before the guarded answer came, "I have heard that the Foundation is
    rich."

    "Rich? Certainly. But our riches are that which you refuse to take. Our nuclear goods are
    worth-"

    "Your goods are worthless in that they lack the ancestral blessing. Your goods are wicked and
    accursed in that they lie under the ancestral interdict." The sentences were intoned; the
    recitation of a formula.

    The Grand Master's eyelids dropped, and he said with meaning, "You have nothing else of
    value?"

    The meaning was lost on the trader, "I don't understand. What is it you want?"

    The Askonian's hands spread apart, "You ask me to trade places with you, and make known to
    you my wants. I think not. Your colleague, it seems, must suffer the punishment set for
    sacrilege by the Askonian code. Death by gas. We are a just people. The poorest peasant, in
    like case, would suffer no more. I, myself, would suffer no less."

    Ponyets mumbled hopelessly, "Your Veneration, would it be permitted that I speak to the
    prisoner?"

    "Askonian law," said the Grand Master coldly, "allows no communication with a condemned
    man."

    Mentally, Ponyets held his breath, "Your Veneration, I ask you to be merciful towards a man's
    soul, in the hour when his body stands forfeit. He has been separated from spiritual consolation
    in all the time that his life has been in danger. Even now, he faces the prospect of going
    unprepared to the bosom of the Spirit that rules all."

    The Grand Master said slowly and suspiciously, "You are a Tender of the Soul?"

    Ponyets dropped a humble head, "I have been so trained. In the empty expanses of space, the
    wandering traders need men like myself to care for the spiritual side of a life so given over to



    commerce and worldly pursuits."

    The Askonian ruler sucked thoughtfully at his lower lip. "Every man should prepare his soul for
    his journey to his ancestral spirits. Yet I had never thought you traders to be believers."


    3 .

    Eskel Gorov stirred on his couch and opened one eye as Limmar Ponyets entered the heavily
    reinforced door. It boomed shut behind him. Gorov sputtered and came to his feet.

    "Ponyets! They sent you?"

    "Pure chance," said Ponyets, bitterly, "or the work of my own personal malevolent demon. Item
    one, you get into a mess on Askone. Item two, my sales route, as known to the Board of Trade,
    carries me within fifty parsecs of the system at just the time of item one. Item three, we've
    worked together before and the Board knows it. Isn't that a sweet, inevitable set-up? The
    answer just pops out of a slot."

    "Be careful," said Gorov, tautly. "There'll be someone listening. Are you wearing a Field
    Distorter?"

    Ponyets indicated the ornamented bracelet that hugged his wrist and Gorov relaxed.

    Ponyets looked about him. The cell was bare, but large. It was well-lit and it lacked offensive
    odors. He said, "Not bad. They're treating you with kid gloves."

    Gorov brushed the remark aside, "Listen, how did you get down here? I've been in strict solitary
    for almost two weeks."

    "Ever since I came, huh? Well, it seems the old bird who's boss here has his weak points. He
    leans toward pious speeches, so I took a chance that worked. I'm here in the capacity of your
    spiritual adviser. There's something about a pious man such as he. He will cheerfully cut your
    throat if it suits him, but he will hesitate to endanger the welfare of your immaterial and
    problematical soul. It's just a piece of empirical psychology. A trader has to know a little of
    everything."

    Gorov's smile was sardonic, "And you've been to theological school as well. You're all right,
    Ponyets. I'm glad they sent you. But the Grand Master doesn't love my soul exclusively. Has he
    mentioned a ransom?"

    The trader's eyes narrowed, "He hinted - barely. And he also threatened death by gas. I played
    safe, and dodged; it might easily have been a trap. So it's extortion, is it? What is it he wants?"

    "Gold."

    "Gold!" Ponyets frowned. "The metal itself? What for?"

    "It's their medium of exchange."

    "Is it? And where do I get gold from?"



    "Wherever you can. Listen to me; this is important. Nothing will happen to me as long as the
    Grand Master has the scent of gold in his nose. Promise it to him; as much as he asks for.
    Then go back to the Foundation, if necessary, to get it. When I'm free, we'll be escorted out of
    the system, and then we part company."

    Ponyets stared disapprovingly, "And then you'll come back and try again."

    "It's my assignment to sell nucleics to Askone."

    "They'll get you before you've gone a parsec in space. You know that, I suppose."

    "I don't," said Gorov. "And if I did, it wouldn't affect things."

    "They'll kill you the second time."

    Gorov shrugged.

    Ponyets said quietly, "If I'm going to negotiate with the Grand Master again, I want to know the
    whole story. So far, I've been working it too blind. As it was, the few mild remarks I did make
    almost threw his Veneration into fits."

    "It's simple enough," said Gorov. "The only way we can increase the security of the Foundation
    here in the Periphery is to form a religion-controlled commercial empire. We're still too weak to
    be able to force political control. It's all we can do to hold the Four Kingdoms."

    Ponyets was nodding. "This I realize. And any system that doesn't accept nuclear gadgets can
    never be placed under our religious control-"

    "And can therefore become a focal point for independence and hostility. Yes."

    "All right, then," said Ponyets, "so much for theory. Now what exactly prevents the sale.
    Religion? The Grand Master implied as much."

    "It's a form of ancestor worship. Their traditions tell of an evil past from which they were saved
    by the simple and virtuous heroes of the past generations. It amounts to a distortion of the
    anarchic period a century ago, when the imperial troops were driven out and an independent
    government was set up. Advanced science and nuclear power in particular became identified
    with the old imperial regime they remember with horror."

    "That so? But they have nice little ships which spotted me very handily two parsecs away. That
    smells of nucleics to me."

    Gorov shrugged. "Those ships are holdovers of the Empire, no doubt. Probably with nuclear
    drive. What they have, they keep. The point is that they will not innovate and their internal
    economy is entirely non-nuclear. That is what we must change."

    "Flow were you going to do it?"

    "By breaking the resistance at one point. To put it simply, if I could sell a penknife with a
    force-field blade to a nobleman, it would be to his interest to force laws that would allow him to
    use it. Put that baldly, it sounds silly, but it is sound, psychologically. To make strategic sales,



    at strategic points, would be to create a pro-nucleics faction at court."

    "And they send you for that purpose, while I'm only here to ransom you and leave, while you
    keep on trying? Isn't that sort of tail-backward?"

    "In what way?" said Gorov, guardedly.

    "Listen," Ponyets was suddenly exasperated, "you're a diplomat, not a trader, and calling you a
    trader won't make you one. This case is for one who's made a business of selling - and I'm
    here with a full cargo stinking into uselessness, and a quota that won't ever be met, it looks
    like."

    "You mean you're going to risk your life on something that isn't your business?" Gorov smiled
    thinly.

    Ponyets said, "You mean that this is a matter of patriotism and traders aren't patriotic?"
    "Notoriously not. Pioneers never are."

    "All right. I'll grant that. I don't scoot about space to save the Foundation or anything like that.
    But I'm out to make money, and this is my chance. If it helps the Foundation at the same time,
    all the better. And I've risked my life on slimmer chances."

    Ponyets rose, and Gorov rose with him, "What are you going to do?"

    The trader smiled, "Gorov, I don't know - not yet. But if the crux of the matter is to make a sale,
    then I'm your man. I'm not a boaster as a general thing, but there's one thing I'll always back
    up. I've never ended up below quota yet."

    The door to the cell opened almost instantly when he knocked, and two guards fell in on either
    side.


    4 .

    "A show!" said the Grand Master, grimly. Fie settled himself well into his furs, and one thin hand
    grasped the iron cudgel he used as a cane.

    "And gold, your Veneration."

    "Anc/ gold," agreed the Grand Master, carelessly.

    Ponyets set the box down and opened it with as fine an appearance of confidence as he could
    manage. Fie felt alone in the face of universal hostility; the way he had felt out in space his first
    year. The semicircle of bearded councilors who faced him down, stared unpleasantly. Among
    them was Pherl, the thin-faced favorite who sat next to the Grand Master in stiff hostility.
    Ponyets had met him once already and marked him immediately as prime enemy, and, as a
    consequence, prime victim.

    Outside the hall, a small army awaited events. Ponyets was effectively isolated from his ship;
    he lacked any weapon, but his attempted bribe; and Gorov was still a hostage.



    He made the final adjustments on the clumsy monstrosity that had cost him a week of
    ingenuity, and prayed once again that the lead-lined quartz would stand the strain.

    "What is it?" asked the Grand Master.

    "This," said Ponyets, stepping back, "is a small device I have constructed myself."

    "That is obvious, but it is not the information I want. Is it one of the black-magic abominations of
    your world?"

    "It is nuclear in nature, admitted Ponyets, gravely, "but none of you need touch it, or have
    anything to do with it. It is for myself alone, and if it contains abominations, I take the foulness
    of it upon myself."

    The Grand Master had raised his iron cane at the machine in a threatening gesture and his lips
    moved rapidly and silently in a purifying invocation. The thin-faced councilor at his right leaned
    towards him and his straggled red mustache approached the Grand Master's ear. The ancient
    Askonian petulantly shrugged himself free.

    "And what is the connection of your instrument of evil and the gold that may save your
    countryman's life?"

    "With this machine," began Ponyets, as his hand dropped softly onto the central chamber and
    caressed its hard, round flanks, "I can turn the iron you discard into gold of the finest quality. It
    is the only device known to man that will take iron - the ugly iron, your Veneration, that props
    up the chair you sit in and the walls of this building - and change it to shining, heavy, yellow
    gold."

    Ponyets felt himself botching it. His usual sales talk was smooth, facile and plausible; but this
    limped like a shot-up space wagon. But it was the content, not the form, that interested the
    Grand Master.

    "So? Transmutation? Men have been fools who have claimed the ability. They have paid for
    their prying sacrilege."

    "Had they succeeded?"

    "No." The Grand Master seemed coldly amused. "Success at producing gold would have been
    a crime that carried its own antidote. It is the attempt plus the failure that is fatal. Here, what
    can you do with my staff?" He pounded the floor with it.

    "Your Veneration will excuse me. My device is a small model, prepared by myself, and your
    staff is too long."

    The Grand Master's small shining eye wandered and stopped, "Randel, your buckles. Come,
    man, they shall be replaced double if need be."

    The buckles passed down the line, hand to hand. The Grand Master weighed them
    thoughtfully.


    Here," he said, and threw them to the floor.



    Ponyets picked them up. He tugged hard before the cylinder opened, and his eyes blinked and
    squinted with effort as he centered the buckles carefully on the anode screen. Later, it would be
    easier but there must be no failures the first time.

    The homemade transmuter crackled malevolently for ten minutes while the odor of ozone
    became faintly present. The Askonians backed away, muttering, and again Pherl whispered
    urgently into his ruler's ear. The Grand Master's expression was stony. He did not budge.

    And the buckles were gold.

    Ponyets held them out to the Grand Master with a murmured, "Your Veneration!" but the old
    man hesitated, then gestured them away. His stare lingered upon the transmuter.

    Ponyets said rapidly, "Gentlemen, this is pure gold. Gold through and through. You may subject
    it to every known physical and chemical test, if you wish to prove the point. It cannot be
    identified from naturally-occurring gold in any way. Any iron can be so treated. Rust will not
    interfere, not will a moderate amount of alloying metals-"

    But Ponyets spoke only to fill a vacuum. He let the buckles remain in his outstretched hand,
    and it was the gold that argued for him.

    The Grand Master stretched out a slow hand at last, and the thin-faced Pherl was roused to
    open speech. "Your Veneration, the gold is from a poisoned source."

    And Ponyets countered, "A rose can grow from the mud, your Veneration. In your dealings with
    your neighbors, you buy material of all imaginable variety, without inquiring as to where they
    get it, whether from an orthodox machine blessed by your benign ancestors or from some
    space-spawned outrage. Come, I don't offer the machine. I offer the gold."

    "Your Veneration," said Pherl, "you are not responsible for the sins of foreigners who work
    neither with your consent nor knowledge. But to accept this strange pseudo-gold made sinfully
    from iron in your presence and with your consent is an affront to the living spirits of our holy
    ancestors."

    "Yet gold is gold," said the Grand Master, doubtfully, "and is but an exchange for the heathen
    person of a convicted felon. Pherl, you are too critical." But he withdrew his hand.

    Ponyets said, "You are wisdom, itself, your Veneration. Consider - to give up a heathen is to
    lose nothing for your ancestors, whereas with the gold you get in exchange you can ornament
    the shrines of their holy spirits. And surely, were gold evil in itself, if such, a thing could be, the
    evil would depart of necessity once the metal were put to such pious use."

    "Now by the bones of my grandfather," said the Grand Master with surprising vehemence. His
    lips separated in a shrill laugh, "Pherl, what do you say of this young man? The statement is
    valid. It is as valid as the words of my ancestors."

    Pherl said gloomily, "So it would seem. Grant that the validity does not turn out to be a device
    of the Malignant Spirit."

    "I'll make it even better," said Ponyets, suddenly. "Hold the gold in hostage. Place it on the



    altars of your ancestors as an offering and hold me for thirty days. If at the end of that time,
    there is no evidence of displeasure - if no disasters occur - surely, it would be proof that the
    offering was accepted. What more can be offered?"

    And when the Grand Master rose to his feet to search out disapproval, not a man in the council
    failed to signal his agreement. Even Pherl chewed the ragged end of his mustache and nodded
    curtly.

    Ponyets smiled and meditated on the uses of a religious education.


    5 .

    Another week rubbed away before the meeting with Pherl was arranged. Ponyets felt the
    tension, but he was used to the feeling of physical helplessness now. He had left city limits
    under guard. He was in Pherl's suburban villa under guard. There was nothing to do but accept
    it without even looking over his shoulder.

    Pherl was taller and younger outside the circle of Elders. In nonformal costume, he seemed no
    Elder at all.

    He said abruptly, "You're a peculiar man." His close-set eyes seemed to quiver. "You've done
    nothing this last week, and particularly these last two hours, but imply that I need gold. It seems
    useless labor, for who does not? Why not advance one step?"

    "It is not simply gold," said Ponyets, discreetly. "Not simply gold. Not merely a coin or two. It is
    rather all that lies behind gold."

    "Now what can lie behind gold?" prodded Pherl, with a down-curved smile. "Certainly this is not
    the preliminary of another clumsy demonstration."

    "Clumsy?" Ponyets frowned slightly.

    "Oh, definitely." Pherl folded his hands and nudged them gently with his chin. "I don't criticize
    you. The clumsiness was on purpose, I am sure. I might have warned his Veneration of that,
    had I been certain of the motive. Now had I been you, I would have produced the gold upon my
    ship, and offered it alone. The show you offered us and the antagonism you aroused would
    have been dispensed with."

    "True," Ponyets admitted, "but since I was myself, I accepted the antagonism for the sake of
    attracting your attention."


    "Is that it? Simply that?" Pherl made no effort to hide his contemptuous amusement. "And I
    imagine you suggested the thirty-day purification period that you might assure yourself time to
    turn the attraction into something a bit more substantial. But what if the gold turns out to be
    impure?"

    Ponyets allowed himself a dark humor in return, "When the judgement of that impurity depends



    upon those who are most interested in finding it pure?"

    Pherl lifted his eyes and stared narrowly at the trader. He seemed at once surprised and
    satisfied.

    "A sensible point. Now tell me why you wished to attract me."

    "This I will do. In the short time I have been here, I have observed useful facts that concern you
    and interest me. For instance, you are young-very young for a member of the council, and even
    of a relatively young family."

    "You criticize my family?"

    "Not at all. Your ancestors are great and holy; all will admit that. But there are those that say
    you are not a member of one of the Five Tribes."

    Pherl leaned back, "With all respect to those involved," and he did not hide his venom, "the Five
    Tribes have impoverished loins and thin blood. Not fifty members of the Tribes are alive."

    "Yet there are those who say the nation would not be willing to see any man outside the Tribes
    as Grand Master. And so young and newly-advanced a favorite of the Grand Master is bound
    to make powerful enemies among the great ones of the State - it is said. His Veneration is
    aging and his protection will not last past his death, when it is an enemy of yours who will
    undoubtedly be the one to interpret the words of his Spirit."

    Pherl scowled, "For a foreigner you hear much. Such ears are made for cropping."

    "That may be decided later."

    "Let me anticipate." Pherl stirred impatiently in his seat. "You're going to offer me wealth and
    power in terms of those evil little machines you carry in your ship. Well?"

    "Suppose it so. What would be your objection? Simply your standard of good and evil?"

    Pherl shook his head. "Not at all. Look, my Outlander, your opinion of us in your heathen
    agnosticism is what it is - but I am not the entire slave of our mythology, though I may appear
    so. I am an educated man, sir, and, I hope, an enlightened one. The full depth of our religious
    customs, in the ritualistic rather than the ethical sense, is for the masses."

    "Your objection, then?" pressed Ponyets, gently.

    "Just that. The masses. I might be willing to deal with you, but your little machines must be
    used to be useful. How might riches come to me, if I had to use - what is it you sell?- well, a
    razor, for instance, only in the strictest, trembling secrecy. Even if my chin were more simply
    and more cleanly shaven, how would I become rich? And how would I avoid death by gas
    chamber or mob frightfulness if I were ever once caught using it?"

    Ponyets shrugged, "You are correct. I might point out that the remedy would be to educate your
    own people into the use of nucleics for their convenience and your own substantial profit. It
    would be a gigantic piece of work; I don't deny it; but the returns would be still more gigantic.

    Still that is your concern, and, at the moment, not mine at all. For I offer neither razor, knife, nor



    mechanical garbage disposer."

    "What do you offer?"

    "Gold itself. Directly. You may have the machine I demonstrated last week."

    And now Pherl stiffened and the skin on his forehead moved jerkily. "The transmuter?"

    "Exactly. Your supply of gold will equal your supply of iron. That, I imagine, is sufficient for all
    needs. Sufficient for the Grand Mastership itself, despite youth and enemies. And it is safe."

    "In what way?"

    "In that secrecy is the essence of its use; that same secrecy you described as the only safety
    with regard to nucleics. You may bury the transmuter in the deepest dungeon of the strongest
    fortress on your furthest estate, and it will still bring you instant wealth. It is the gold you buy,
    not the machine, and that gold bears no trace of its manufacture, for it cannot be told from the
    natural creation."

    "And who is to operate the machine?"

    "Yourself. Five minutes teaching is all you will require. I'll set it up for you wherever you wish."
    "And in return?"

    "Well," Ponyets grew cautious. "I ask a price and a handsome one. It is my living. Let us say,-
    for it its a valuable machine - the equivalent of a cubic foot of gold in wrought iron."

    Pherl laughed, and Ponyets grew red. "I point out, sir," he added, stiffly, "that you can get your
    price back in two hours."

    "True, and in one hour, you might be gone, and my machine might suddenly turn out to be
    useless. I'll need a guarantee."

    "You have my word."

    "A very good one," Pherl bowed sardonically, "but your presence would be an even better
    assurance. I'll give you my word to pay you one week after delivery in working order."

    "Impossible."

    "Impossible? When you've already incurred the death penalty very handily by even offering to
    sell me anything. The only alternative is my word that you'll get the gas chamber tomorrow
    otherwise."

    Ponyet's face was expressionless, but his eyes might have flickered. He said, "It is an unfair
    advantage. You will at least put your promise in writing?"

    "And also become liable for execution? No, sir!" Pherl smiled a broad satisfaction. "No, sir! Only
    one of us is a fool."


    The trader said in a small voice, "It is agreed, then.



    6 .


    Gorov was released on the thirtieth day, and five hundred pounds of the yellowest gold took his
    place. And with him was released the quarantined and untouched abomination that was his
    ship.

    Then, as on the journey into the Askonian system, so on the journey out, the cylinder of sleek
    little ships ushered them on their way.

    Ponyets watched the dimly sun-lit speck that was Gorov's ship while Gorov's voice pierced
    through to him, clear and thin on the tight, distortion-bounded ether-beam.

    He was saying, "But it isn't what's wanted, Ponyets. A transmuter won't do. Where did you get
    one, anyway?"

    "I didn't," Ponyets answer was patient. "I juiced it up out of a food irradiation chamber. It isn't
    any good, really. The power consumption is prohibitive on any large scale or the Foundation
    would use transmutation instead of chasing all over the Galaxy for heavy metals. It's one of the
    standard tricks every trader uses, except that I never saw an iron-to-gold one before. But it's
    impressive, and it works - very temporarily."

    "All right. But that particular trick is no good."

    "It got you out of a nasty spot."

    "That is very far from the point. Especially since I've got to go back, once we shake our
    solicitous escort."

    "Why?"

    "You yourself explained it to this politician of yours," Gorov's voice was on edge. "Your entire
    sales-point rested on the fact that the transmuter was a means to an end, but of no value in
    itself-, that he was buying the gold, not the machine. It was good psychology, since it worked,
    but-"

    "But?" Ponyets urged blandly and obtusely.

    The voice from the receiver grew shriller, "But we want to sell them a machine of value in itself,
    something they would want to use openly; something that would tend to force them out in favor
    of nuclear techniques as a matter of self-interest."

    "I understand all that," said Ponyets, gently. "You once explained it. But look at what follows
    from my sale, will you? As long as that transmuter lasts, Pherl will coin gold; and it will last long
    enough to buy him the next election. The present Grand Master won't last long."

    "You count on gratitude?" asked Gorov, coldly.

    "No - on intelligent self-interest. The transmuter gets him an election; other mechanisms-"

    "No! No! Your premise is twisted. It's not the transmuter, he'll credit - it'll be the good,



    old-fashioned gold. That's what I'm trying to tell you."

    Ponyets grinned and shifted into a more comfortable position. All right. He'd baited the poor
    fellow sufficiently. Gorov was beginning to sound wild.

    The trader said, "Not so fast, Gorov. I haven't finished. There are other gadgets already
    involved."

    There was a short silence. Then, Gorov's voice sounded cautiously, "What other gadgets?"
    Ponyets gestured automatically and uselessly, "You see that escort?"

    "I do," said Gorov shortly. "Tell me about those gadgets."

    "I will, -if you'll listen. That's Pherl's private navy escorting us; a special honor to him from the
    Grand Master. He managed to squeeze that out."

    "So?"

    "And where do you think he's taking us? To his mining estates on the outskirts of Askone, that's
    where. Listen!" Ponyets was suddenly fiery, "I told you I was in this to make money, not to save
    worlds. All right. I sold that transmuter for nothing. Nothing except the risk of the gas chamber
    and that doesn't count towards the quota."

    "Get back to the mining estates, Ponyets. Where do they come in?"

    "With the profits. We're stacking up on tin, Gorov. Tin to fill every last cubic foot this old scow
    can scrape up, and then some more for yours. I'm going down with Pherl to collect, old man,
    and you're going to cover me from upstairs with every gun you've got - just in case Pherl isn't
    as sporting about the matter as he lets on to be. That tin's my profit."

    "For the transmuter?"

    "For my entire cargo of nucleics. At double price, plus a bonus." He shrugged, almost
    apologetically. "I admit I gouged him, but I've got to make quota, don't I?"

    Gorov was evidently lost. He said, weakly, "Do you mind explaining'?"

    "What's there to explain? It's obvious, Gorov. Look, the clever dog thought he had me in a
    foolproof trap, because his word was worth more than mine to the Grand Master. He took the
    transmuter. That was a capital crime in Askone. But at any time he could say that he had lured
    me on into a trap with the purest of patriotic motives, and denounce me as a seller of forbidden
    things."

    "That was obvious."

    "Sure, but word against simple word wasn't all there was to it. You see, Pherl had never heard
    nor conceived of a microfilm-recorder."

    Gorov laughed suddenly.

    "That's right," said Ponyets. "He had the upper hand. I was properly chastened. But when I set



    up the transmuter for him in my whipped-dog fashion, I incorporated the recorder into the
    device and removed it in the next day's overhaul. I had a perfect record of his sanctum
    sanctorum, his holy-of-holies, with he himself, poor Pherl, operating the transmuter for all the
    ergs it had and crowing over his first piece of gold as if it were an egg he had just laid."

    "You showed him the results?"

    "Two days later. The poor sap had never seen three-dimensional color-sound images in his life.
    He claims he isn't superstitious, but if I ever saw an adult look as scared as he did then, call me
    rookie. When I told him I had a recorder planted in the city square, set to go off at midday with a
    million fanatical Askonians to watch, and to tear him to pieces subsequently, he was gibbering
    at my knees in half a second. He was ready to make any deal I wanted."

    "Did you?" Gorov's voice was suppressing laughter. "I mean, have one planted in the city
    square."

    "No, but that didn't matter. He made the deal. He bought every gadget I had, and every one you
    had for as much tin as we could carry. At that moment, he believed me capable of anything.

    The agreement is in writing and you'll have a copy before I go down with him, just as another
    precaution."

    "But you've damaged his ego," said Gorov. "Will he use the gadgets?"

    "Why not? It's his only way of recouping his losses, and if he makes money out of it, he'll salve
    his pride. And he will be the next Grand Master - and the best man we could have in our favor."

    "Yes," said Gorov, "it was a good sale. Yet you've certainly got an uncomfortable sales
    technique. No wonder you were kicked out of a seminary. Have you no sense of morals?"

    "What are the odds?" said Ponyets, indifferently. "You know what Salvor Hardin said about a
    sense of morals."


    PART V

    THE MERCHANT PRINCES


    i.

    TRADERS-... With psychohistoric inevitability, economic control of the Foundation grew. The
    traders grew rich; and with riches came power....

    It is sometimes forgotten that Hober Mallow began life as an ordinary trader. It is never
    forgotten that he ended it as the first of the Merchant Princes....


    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA




    Jorane Sutt put the tips of carefully-manicured fingers together and said, "It's something of a
    puzzle. In fact - and this is in the strictest of confidence - it may be another one of Hari
    Seldon's crises."

    The man opposite felt in the pocket of his short Smyrnian jacket for a cigarette. "Don't know
    about that, Sutt. As a general rule, politicians start shouting 'Seldon crisis' at every mayoralty
    campaign."

    Sutt smiled very faintly, "I'm not campaigning, Mallow. We're facing nuclear weapons, and we
    don't know where they're coming from."

    Hober Mallow of Smyrno, Master Trader, smoked quietly, almost indifferently. "Go on. If you
    have more to say, get it out." Mallow never made the mistake of being overpolite to a
    Foundation man. He might be an Outlander, but a man's a man for a’ that.

    Sutt indicated the trimensional star-map on the table. He adjusted the controls and a cluster of
    some half-dozen stellar systems blazed red.

    'That," he said quietly, "is the Korellian Republic."

    The trader nodded, "I've been there. Stinking rathole! I suppose you can call it a republic but it's
    always someone out of the Argo family that gets elected Commdor each time. And if you ever
    don't like it - things happen to you." He twisted his lip and repeated, "I've been there."

    "But you've come back, which hasn't always happened. Three trade ships, inviolate under the
    Conventions, have disappeared within the territory of the Republic in the last year. And those
    ships were armed with all the usual nuclear explosives and force-field defenses."

    "What was the last word heard from the ships?"

    "Routine reports. Nothing else."

    "What did Korell say?"

    Sutt's eyes gleamed sardonically, "There was no way of asking. The Foundation's greatest
    asset throughout the Periphery is its reputation of power. Do you think we can lose three ships
    and ask for them?"

    "Well, then, suppose you tell me what you want with me."

    Jorane Sutt did not waste his time in the luxury of annoyance. As secretary to the mayor, he
    had held off opposition councilmen, jobseekers, reformers, and crackpots who claimed to have
    solved in its entirety the course of future history as worked out by Hari Seldon. With training like
    that, it took a good deal to disturb him.

    He said methodically, "In a moment. You see, three ships lost in the same sector in the same
    year can't be accident, and nuclear power can be conquered only by more nuclear power. The
    question automatically arises: if Korell has nuclear weapons, where is it getting them?"


    And where does it?



    "Two alternatives. Either the Korellians have constructed them themselves-"

    "Far-fetched!"

    "Very! But the other possibility is that we are being afflicted with a case of treason."

    "You think so?" Mallow's voice was cold.

    The secretary said calmly, "There's nothing miraculous about the possibility. Since the Four
    Kingdoms accepted the Foundation Convention, we have had to deal with considerable groups
    of dissident populations in each nation. Each former kingdom has its pretenders and its former
    noblemen, who can't very well pretend to love the Foundation. Some of them are becoming
    active, perhaps."

    Mallow was a dull red. "I see. Is there anything you want to say to me? I'm a Smyrnian."

    "I know. You're a Smyrnian - born in Smyrno, one of the former Four Kingdoms. You're a
    Foundation man by education only. By birth, you're an Outlander and a foreigner. No doubt
    your grandfather was a baron at the time of the wars with Anacreon and Loris, and no doubt
    your family estates were taken away when Sef Sermak redistributed the land."

    "No, by Black Space, no! My grandfather was a blood-poor son-of-a-spacer who died heaving
    coal at starving wages before the Foundation took over. I owe nothing to the old regime. But I
    was born in Smyrno, and I'm not ashamed of either Smyrno or Smyrnians, by the Galaxy. Your
    sly little hints of treason aren't going to panic me into licking Foundation spittle. And now you
    can either give your orders or make your accusations. I don't care which."

    "My good Master Trader, I don't care an electron whether your grandfather was King of Smyrno
    or the greatest pauper on the planet. I recited that rigmarole about your birth and ancestry to
    show you that I'm not interested in them. Evidently, you missed the point. Let's go back now.
    You're a Smyrnian. You know the Outlanders. Also, you're a trader and one of the best. You've
    been to Korell and you know the Korellians. That's where you've got to go."

    Mallow breathed deeply, "As a spy?"

    "Not at all. As a trader - but with your eyes open. If you can find out where the power is coming
    from - I might remind you, since you're a Smyrnian, that two of those lost trade ships had
    Smyrnian crews."

    "When do I start?"

    "When will your ship be ready?"

    "In six days."

    "Then that's when you start. You'll have all the details at the Admiralty."

    "Right!" The trader rose, shook hands roughly, and strode out.

    Sutt waited, spreading his fingers gingerly and rubbing out the pressure; then shrugged his
    shoulders and stepped into the mayor's office.



    The mayor deadened the visiplate and leaned back. "What do you make of it, Sutt?"
    "He could be a good actor," said Sutt, and stared thoughtfully ahead.


    2 .

    It was evening of the same day, and in Jorane Sutt's bachelor apartment on the twenty-first
    floor of the Hardin Building, Publis Manlio was sipping wine slowly.

    It was Publis Manlio in whose slight, aging body were fulfilled two great offices of the
    Foundation. He was Foreign Secretary in the mayor's cabinet, and to all the outer suns, barring
    only the Foundation itself, he was, in addition, Primate of the Church, Purveyor of the Holy
    Food, Master of the Temples, and so forth almost indefinitely in confusing but sonorous
    syllables.

    He was saying, "But he agreed to let you send out that trader. It is a point."

    "But such a small one," said Sutt. "It gets us nothing immediately. The whole business is the
    crudest sort of stratagem, since we have no way of foreseeing it to the end. It is a mere paying
    out of rope on the chance that somewhere along the length of it will be a noose."

    "True. And this Mallow is a capable man. What if he is not an easy prey to dupery?"

    "That is a chance that must be run. If there is treachery, it is the capable men that are
    implicated. If not, we need a capable man to detect the truth. And Mallow will be guarded. Your
    glass is empty."

    "No, thanks. I've had enough."

    Sutt filled his own glass and patiently endured the other's uneasy reverie.

    Of whatever the reverie consisted, it ended indecisively, for the primate said suddenly, almost
    explosively, "Sutt, what's on your mind?"

    "I'll tell you, Manlio." His thin lips parted, "We're in the middle of a Seldon crisis."

    Manlio stared, then said softly, "How do you know? Has Seldon appeared in the Time Vault
    again?"

    "That much, my friend, is not necessary. Look, reason it out. Since the Galactic Empire
    abandoned the Periphery, and threw us on our own, we have never had an opponent who
    possessed nuclear power. Now, for the first time, we have one. That seems significant even if it
    stood by itself. And it doesn't. For the first time in over seventy years, we are facing a major
    domestic political crisis. I should think the synchronization of the two crises, inner and outer,
    puts it beyond all doubt."

    Manlio's eyes narrowed, "If that's all, it's not enough. There have been two Seldon crises so far,
    and both times the Foundation was in danger of extermination. Nothing can be a third crisis till
    that danger returns."



    Sutt never showed impatience, "That danger is coming. Any fool can tell a crisis when it arrives.
    The real service to the state is to detect it in embryo. Look, Manlio, we're proceeding along a
    planned history. We know that Hari Seldon worked out the historical probabilities of the future.
    We know that some day we're to rebuild the Galactic Empire. We know that it will take a
    thousand years or thereabouts. And we know that in the interval we will face certain definite
    crises.

    "Now the first crisis came fifty years after the establishment of the Foundation, and the second,
    thirty years later than that. Almost seventy-five years have gone since. It's time, Manlio, it's
    time."

    Manlio rubbed his nose uncertainly, "And you've made your plans to meet this crisis?"

    Sutt nodded.

    "And I," continued Manlio, "am to play a part in it?"

    Sutt nodded again, "Before we can meet the foreign threat of atomic power, we've got to put
    our own house in order. These traders-"

    "Ah!" The primate stiffened, and his eyes grew sharp.

    "That's right. These traders. They are useful, but they are too strong - and too uncontrolled.
    They are Outlanders, educated apart from religion. On the one hand, we put knowledge into
    their hands, and on the other, we remove our strongest hold upon them."

    "If we can prove treachery?"

    "If we could, direct action would be simple and sufficient. But that doesn't signify in the least.
    Even if treason among them did not exist, they would form an uncertain element in our society.
    They wouldn't be bound to us by patriotism or common descent, or even by religious awe.
    Under their secular leadership, the outer provinces, which, since Hardin's time, look to us as
    the Holy Planet, might break away."

    "I see all that, but the cure-"

    "The cure must come quickly, before the Seldon Crisis becomes acute. If nuclear weapons are
    without and disaffection within, the odds might be too great." Sutt put down the empty glass he
    had been fingering, "This is obviously your job."

    "Mine?"

    "I can't do it. My office is appointive and has no legislative standing."

    "The mayor-"

    "Impossible. His personality is entirely negative. He is energetic only in evading responsibility.
    But if an independent party arose that might endanger re-election, he might allow himself to be
    led."

    "But, Sutt, I lack the aptitude for practical politics."



    "Leave that to me. Who knows, Manlio? Since Salvor Hardin's time, the primacy and the
    mayoralty have never been combined in a single person. But it might happen now - if your job
    were well done."


    3 .

    And at the other end of town, in homelier surroundings, Hober Mallow kept a second
    appointment. He had listened long, and now he said cautiously, "Yes, I've heard of your
    campaigns to get trader representation in the council. But why me, Twer?"

    Jaim Twer, who would remind you any time, asked or unasked, that he was in the first group of
    Outlanders to receive a lay education at the Foundation, beamed.

    "I know what I'm doing," he said. "Remember when I met you first, last year."

    "At the Trader's Convention."

    "Right. You ran the meeting. You had those red-necked oxen planted in their seats, then put
    them in your shirtpocket and walked off with them. And you're all right with the Foundation
    masses, too. You've got glamor- or, at any rate, solid adventure-publicity, which is the same
    thing."

    "Very good," said Mallow, dryly. "But why now?"

    'Because now's our chance. Do you know that the Secretary of Education has handed in his
    resignation? It's not out in the open yet, but it will be."

    "How do you know?"

    "That - never mind-" He waved a disgusted hand. "It's so. The Actionist party is splitting wide
    open, and we can murder it right now on a straight question of equal rights for traders; or,
    rather, democracy, pro- and anti-."

    Mallow lounged back in his chair and stared at his thick fingers, "Uh-uh. Sorry, Twer. I'm
    leaving next week on business. You'll have to get someone else."

    Twer stared, "Business? What kind of business?"

    "Very super-secret. Triple-A priority. All that, you know. Had a talk with the mayor's own
    secretary."

    "Snake Sutt?" Jaim Twer grew excited. "A trick. The son-of-a-spacer is getting rid of you.
    Mallow-"

    "Hold on!" Mallow's hand fell on the other's balled fist. "Don't go into a blaze. If it's a trick, I'll be
    back some day for the reckoning, if it isn't, your snake, Sutt, is playing into our hands. Listen,
    there's a Seldon crisis coming up."

    Mallow waited for a reaction but it never came. Twer merely stared. "What's a Seldon crisis?"



    "Galaxy!" Mallow exploded angrily at the anticlimax, "What the blue blazes did you do when you
    went to school? What do you mean anyway by a fool question like that?"

    The elder man frowned, "If you'll explain-"

    There was a long pause, then, "I'll explain." Mallow's eyebrows lowered, and he spoke slowly.
    "When the Galactic Empire began to die at the edges, and when the ends of the Galaxy
    reverted to barbarism and dropped away, Hari Seldon and his band of psychologists planted a
    colony, the Foundation, out here in the middle of the mess, so that we could incubate art,
    science, and technology, and form the nucleus of the Second Empire."

    "Oh, yes, yes-"

    "I'm not finished," said the trader, coldly. "The future course of the Foundation was plotted
    according to the science of psychohistory, then highly developed, and conditions arranged so
    as to bring about a series of crises that will force us most rapidly along the route to future
    Empire. Each crisis, each Seldon crisis, marks an epoch in our history. We're approaching one
    now - our third."

    Twer shrugged. "I suppose this was mentioned in school, but I've been out of school a long
    time - longer than you."

    "I suppose so. Forget it. What matters is that I'm being sent out into the middle of the
    development of this crisis. There's no telling what I'll have when I come back, and there is a
    council election every year."

    Twer looked up, "Are you on the track of anything?"

    "No."

    "You have definite plans?"

    "Not the faintest inkling of one."

    "Well-"

    "Well, nothing. Hardin once said: 'To succeed, planning alone is insufficient. One must
    improvise as well.' I'll improvise."

    Twer shook his head uncertainly, and they stood, looking at each other.

    Mallow said, quite suddenly, but quite matter-of-factly, "I tell you what, how about coming with
    me? Don't stare, man. You've been a trader before you decided them was more excitement in
    politics. Or so I've heard."

    "Where are you going? Tell me that."

    Towards the Whassallian Rift. I can't be more specific till we're out in space. What do you say?"
    Suppose Sutt decides he wants me where he can see

    "Not likely. If he's anxious to get rid of me, why not of you as well? Besides which, no trader



    would hit space if he couldn't pick his own crew. I take whom I please."

    There was a queer glint in the older man's eyes, "All right. I'll go." He held out his hand, "It'll be
    my first trip in three years."

    Mallow grasped and shook the other's hand, "Good! All fired good! And now I've got to round
    up the boys. You know where the Far Star docks, don 't you? Then show up tomorrow.
    Good-by."


    4 .

    Korell is that frequent phenomenon in history: the republic whose ruler has every attribute of
    the absolute monarch but the name. It therefore enjoyed the usual despotism unrestrained
    even by those two moderating influences in the legitimate monarchies: regal "honor" and court
    etiquette.

    Materially, its prosperity was low. The day of the Galactic Empire had departed, with nothing
    but silent memorials and broken structures to testify to it. The day of the Foundation had not yet
    come - and in the fierce determination of its ruler, the Commdor Asper Argo, with his strict
    regulation of the traders and his stricter prohibition of the missionaries, it was never coming.

    The spaceport itself was decrepit and decayed, and the crew of the Far Star were drearily
    aware of that. The moldering hangars made for a moldering atmosphere and Jaim Twer itched
    and fretted over a game of solitaire.

    Hober Mallow said thoughtfully, "Good trading material here." He was staring quietly out the
    viewport. So far, there was little else to be said about Korell. The trip here was uneventful. The
    squadron of Korellian ships that had shot out to intercept the Far Star had been tiny, limping
    relics of ancient glory or battered, clumsy hulks. They had maintained their distance fearfully,
    and still maintained it, and for a week now, Mallow's requests for an audience with the local go
    government had been unanswered.

    Mallow repeated, "Good trading here. You might call this virgin territory."

    Jaim Twer looked up impatiently, and threw his cards aside, "What the devil do you intend
    doing, Mallow? The crew's grumbling, the officers are worried, and I’m wondering-"

    "Wondering? About what?"

    "About the situation. And about you. What are we doing?"

    "Waiting."

    The old trader snorted and grew red. He growled, "You're going it blind, Mallow. There's a
    guard around the field and there are ships overhead. Suppose they're getting ready to blow us
    into a hole in the ground."

    "They've had a week."



    "Maybe they're waiting for reinforcements." Twer's eyes were sharp and hard.

    Mallow sat down abruptly, "Yes, I'd thought of that You see, it poses a pretty problem. First, we
    got here without trouble. That may mean nothing, however, for only three ships out of better
    than three hundred went a-glimmer last year. The percentage is low. But that may mean also
    that the number of their ships equipped with nuclear power is small, and that they dare not
    expose them needlessly, until that number grows.

    "But it could mean, on the other hand, that they haven't nuclear power after all. Or maybe they
    have and are keeping undercover, for fear we know something. It's one thing, after all, to
    piratize blundering, light-armed merchant ships. It's another to fool around with an accredited
    envoy of the Foundation when the mere fact of his presence may mean the Foundation is
    growing suspicious.

    "Combine this-"

    "Flold on, Mallow, hold on." Twer raised his hands. "You're just about drowning me with talk.
    What're you getting at? Never mind the in-betweens."

    "You've got to have the in-betweens, or you won't understand, Twer. We're both waiting. They
    don't know what I'm doing here and I don't know what they've got here. But I'm in the weaker
    position because I'm one and they're an entire world - maybe with atomic power. I can't afford
    to be the one to weaken. Sure it's dangerous. Sure there may be a hole in the ground waiting
    for us. But we knew that from the start. What else is there to do?"

    "I don't- Who's that, now?"

    Mallow looked up patiently, and tuned the receiver. The visiplate glowed into the craggy face of
    the watch sergeant.

    "Speak, sergeant."

    The sergeant said, "Pardon, sir. The men have given entry to a Foundation missionary."

    "A what?' Mallow's face grew livid.

    "A missionary, sit. Fle's in need of hospitalization, sir-"

    "There'll be more than one in need of that, sergeant, for this piece of work. Order the men to
    battle stations."

    Crew's lounge was almost empty. Five minutes after the order, even the men on the off-shift
    were at their guns. It was speed that was the great virtue in the anarchic regions of the
    interstellar space of the Periphery, and it was in speed above all that the crew of a master
    trader excelled.

    Mallow entered slowly, and stared the missionary up and down and around. His eye slid to
    Lieutenant Tinter, who shifted uneasily to one side and to Watch-Sergeant Demen, whose
    blank face and stolid figure flanked the other.

    The Master Trader turned to Twer and paused thoughtfully, "Well, then, Twer, get the officers



    here quietly, except for the co-ordinators and the trajectorian. The men are to remain at stations
    till further orders."

    There was a five-minute hiatus, in which Mallow kicked open the doors to the lavatories, looked
    behind the bar, pulled the draperies across the thick windows. For half a minute he left the
    room altogether, and when he returned he was humming abstractedly.

    Men filed in. Twer followed, and closed the door silently.

    Mallow said quietly, "First, who let this man in without orders from me?"

    The watch sergeant stepped forward. Every eye shifted. "Pardon, sir. It was no definite person.
    It was a sort of mutual agreement. Fie was one of us, you might say, and these foreigners
    here-"

    Mallow cut him short, "I sympathize with your feelings, sergeant, and understand them. These
    men, were they under your command?"

    "Yes, sir."

    "When this is over, they're to be confined to individual quarters for a week. You yourself are
    relieved of all supervisory duties for a similar period. Understood?"

    The sergeant's face never changed, but there was the slightest droop to his shoulders. Fie said,
    crisply, "Yes, sir."

    "You may leave. Get to your gun-station."

    The door closed behind him and the babble rose.

    Twer broke in, "Why the punishment, Mallow? You know that these Korellians kill captured
    missionaries."

    "An action against my orders is bad in itself whatever other reasons there may be in its favor.

    No one was to leave or enter the ship without permission."

    Lieutenant Tinter murmured rebelliously, "Seven days without action. You can't maintain
    discipline that way."

    Mallow said icily, "/can. There's no merit in discipline under ideal circumstances. I'll have it in
    the face of death, or it's useless. Where's this missionary? Get him here in front of me."

    The trader sat down, while the scarlet-cloaked figure was carefully brought forward.

    "What's your name, reverend?"

    "Eh?" The scarlet-robed figure wheeled towards Mallow, the whole body turning as a unit. FHis
    eyes were blankly open and there was a bruise on one temple. Fie had not spoken, nor, as far
    as Mallow could tell, moved during all the previous interval.

    "Your name, revered one?"

    The missionary started to sudden feverish life. FHis arms went out in an embracing gesture. "My



    son - my children. May you always be in the protecting arms of the Galactic Spirit."

    Twer stepped forward, eyes troubled, voice husky, "The man's sick. Take him to bed,
    somebody. Order him to bed, Mallow, and have him seen to. He's badly hurt."

    Mallow's great arm shoved him back, "Don't interfere, Twer, or I'll have you out of the room.
    Your name, revered one?"

    The missionary's hands clasped in sudden supplication, "As you are enlightened men, save me
    from the heathen." The words tumbled out, "Save me from these brutes and darkened ones
    who raven after me and would afflict the Galactic Spirit with their crimes. I am Jord Parma, of
    the Anacreonian worlds. Educated at the Foundation; the Foundation itself, my children. I am a
    Priest of the Spirit educated into all the mysteries, who have come here where the inner voice
    called me." He was gasping. "I have suffered at the hands of the unenlightened. As you are
    Children of the Spirit; and in the name of that Spirit, protect me from them."

    A voice broke in upon them, as the emergency alarm box clamored metallically:

    "Enemy units in sight! Instruction desired!"

    Every eye shot mechanically upward to the speaker.

    Mallow swore violently. He clicked open the reverse and yelled, "Maintain vigil! That is all!" and
    turned it off.

    He made his way to the thick drapes that rustled aside at a touch and stared grimly out,

    Enemy units! Several thousands of them in the persons of the individual members of a
    Korellian mob. The rolling rabble encompassed the port from extreme end to extreme end, and
    in the cold, hard light of magnesium flares the foremost straggled closer.

    "Tinter!" The trader never turned, but the back of his neck was red. "Get the outer speaker
    working and find out what they want. Ask if they have a representative of the law with them.
    Make no promises and no threats, or I'll kill you."

    Tinter turned and left.

    Mallow felt a rough hand on his shoulder and he struck it aside. It was Twer. His voice was an
    angry hiss in his ear, "Mallow, you're bound to hold onto this man. There's no way of
    maintaining decency and honor otherwise. He's of the Foundation and, after all, he - is a priest.
    These savages outside- Do you hear me?"

    "I hear you, Twer." Mallow's voice was incisive. "I've got more to do here than guard
    missionaries. I'll do, sir, what I please, and, by Seldon and all the Galaxy, if you try to stop me,
    I'll tear out your stinking windpipe. Don't get in my way, Twer, or it will be the last of you."

    He turned and strode past. "You! Revered Parma! Did you know that, by convention, no
    Foundation missionaries may enter the Korellian territory?"

    The missionary was trembling, "I can but go where the Spirit leads, my son. If the darkened
    ones refuse enlightenment, is it not the greater sign of their need for it?"



    "That's outside the question, revered one. You are here against the law of both Korell and the
    Foundation. I cannot in law protect you."

    The missionary's hands were raised again. His earlier bewilderment was gone. There was the
    raucous clamor of the ship's outer communication system in action, and the faint, undulating
    gabble of the angry horde in response. The sound made his eyes wild.

    "You hear them? Why do you talk of law to me, of a law made by men? There are higher laws.
    Was it not the Galactic Spirit that said: Thou shalt not stand idly by to the hurl of thy fellowman.
    And has he not said: Even as thou dealest with the humble and defenseless, thus shalt thou be
    dealt with.

    "Have you not guns? Have you not a ship? And behind you is there not the Foundation? And
    above and all-about you is there not the Spirit that rules the universe?" He paused for breath.

    And then the great outer voice of the Far Star ceased and Lieutenant Tinter was back, troubled.

    "Speak!" said Mallow, shortly.

    "Sir, they demand the person of Jord Parma."

    "If not?"

    "There are various threats, sir. It is difficult to make much out. There are so many - and they
    seem quite mad. There is someone who says he governs the district and has police powers,
    but he is quite evidently not his own master."

    "Master or not," shrugged Mallow, "he is the law. Tell them that if this governor, or policeman,
    or whatever he is, approaches the ship alone, he can have the Revered Jord Parma."

    And there was suddenly a gun in his hand. He added, "I don't know what insubordination is. I
    have never had any experience with it. But if there's anyone here who thinks he can teach me,
    I'd like to teach him my antidote in return."

    The gun swiveled slowly, and rested on Twer. With an effort, the old trader's face untwisted and
    his hands unclenched and lowered. His breath was a harsh rasp in his nostrils.

    Tinter left, and in five minutes a puny figure detached itself from the crowd. It approached
    slowly and hesitantly, plainly drenched in fear and apprehension. Twice it turned back, and
    twice the patently obvious threats of the many-headed monster urged him on.

    "All right," Mallow gestured with the hand-blaster, which remained unsheathed. "Grun and
    Upshur, take him out."

    The missionary screeched. He raised his arms and rigid fingers speared upward as the
    voluminous sleeves fell away to reveal the thin, veined arms. There was a momentary, tiny
    flash of light that came and went in a breath. Mallow blinked and gestured again,
    contemptuously.

    The missionary's voice poured out as he struggled in the two-fold grasp, "Cursed be the traitor
    who abandons his fellowman to evil and to death. Deafened be the ears that are deaf to the



    pleadings of the helpless. Blind be the eyes that are blind to innocence. Blackened forever be
    the soul that consorts with blackness-"

    Twer clamped his hands tightly over his ears.

    Mallow flipped his blaster and put it away. "Disperse," he said, evenly, "to respective stations.
    Maintain full vigil for six hours after dispersion of crowd. Double stations for forty-eight hours
    thereafter. Further instructions at that time. Twer, come with me."

    They were alone in Mallow's private quarters. Mallow indicated a chair and Twer sat down. His
    stocky figure looked shrunken.

    Mallow stared him down, sardonically. "Twer," he said, "I'm disappointed. Your three years in
    politics seem to have gotten you out of trader habits. Remember, I may be a democrat back at
    the Foundation, but there's nothing short of tyranny that can run my ship the way I want it run. I
    never had to pull a blaster on my men before, and I wouldn't have had to now, if you hadn't
    gone out of line.

    "Twer, you have no official position, but you're here on my invitation, and I'll extend you every
    courtesy - in private. However, from now on, in the presence of my officers or men, I'm 'sir,'
    and not 'Mallow.' And when I give an order, you'll jump faster than a third-class recruit just for
    luck, or I'll have you handcuffed in the sub-level even faster. Understand?"

    The party-leader swallowed dryly. He said, reluctantly, "My apologies."

    "Accepted! Will you shake?"

    Twer's limp fingers were swallowed in Mallow's huge palm. Twer said, "My motives were good.
    It's difficult to send a man out to be lynched. That wobbly-kneed governor or whatever-he-was
    can't save him. It's murder."

    "I can't help that. Frankly, the incident smelled too bad. Didn't you notice?"

    "Notice what?"

    "This spaceport is deep in the middle of a sleepy far section. Suddenly a missionary escapes.
    Where from? He comes here. Coincidence? A huge crowd gathers. From where? The nearest
    city of any size must be at least a hundred miles away. But they arrive in half an hour. How?"

    "How?" echoed Twer.

    "Well, what if the missionary were brought here and released as bait. Our friend, Revered
    Parma, was considerably confused. He seemed at no time to be in complete possession of his
    wits."

    "Hard usage-" murmured Twer bitterly.

    "Maybe! And maybe the idea was to have us go all chivalrous and gallant, into a stupid defense
    of the man. He was here against the laws of Korell and the Foundation. If I withhold him, it is an
    act of war against Korell, and the Foundation would have no legal right to defend us."

    "That - that's pretty far-fetched."



    The speaker blared and forestalled Mallow's answer: "Sir, official communication received."
    "Submit immediately!"

    The gleaming cylinder arrived in its slot with a click. Mallow opened it and shook out the
    silver-impregnated sheet it held. He rubbed it appreciatively between thumb and finger and
    said, "Teleported direct from the capital. Commdor's own stationery."

    He read it in a glance and laughed shortly, "So my idea was far-fetched, was it?"

    He tossed it to Twer, and added, "Half an hour after we hand back the missionary, we finally
    get a very polite invitation to the Commdor's august presence - after seven days of previous
    waiting. / think we passed a test."


    5 .

    Commdor Asper was a man of the people, by self-acclamation. His remaining back-fringe of
    gray hair drooped limply to his shoulders, his shirt needed laundering, and he spoke with a
    snuffle.

    "There is no ostentation here, Trader Mallow," he said. "No false show. In me, you see merely
    the first citizen of the state. That's what Commdor means, and that's the only title I have."

    He seemed inordinately pleased with it all, "in fact, I consider that fact one of the strongest
    bonds between Korell and your nation. I understand you people enjoy the republican blessings
    we do."

    "Exactly, Commdor," said Mallow gravely, taking mental exception to the comparison, "an
    argument which I consider strongly in favor of continued peace and friendship between our
    governments."

    "Peace! Ah!" The Commdor's sparse gray beard twitched to the sentimental grimaces of his
    face. "I don't think there is anyone in the Periphery who has so near his heart the ideal of
    Peace, as I have. I can truthfully say that since I succeeded my illustrious father to the
    leadership of the state, the reign of Peace has never been broken. Perhaps I shouldn't say it"
    -he coughed gently- "but I have been told that my people, my fellow-citizens rather, know me
    as Asper, the Well-Beloved."

    Mallow's eyes wandered over the well-kept garden. Perhaps the tall men and the
    strangely-designed but openly-vicious weapons they carried just happened to be lurking in odd
    comers as a precaution against himself. That would be understandable. But the lofty,
    steel-girdered walls that circled the place had quite obviously been recently strengthened - an
    unfitting occupation for such a Well-Beloved Asper.

    He said, "It is fortunate that I have you to deal with then, Commdor. The despots and monarchs
    of surrounding worlds, which haven't the benefit of enlightened administration, often lack the
    qualities that would make a ruler well-beloved."


    Such as?" There was a cautious note in the Commdor's voice.



    "Such as a concern for the best interests of their people, You, on the other hand, would
    understand,"

    The Commdor kept his eyes on the gravel path as they walked leisurely, His hands caressed
    each other behind his back.

    Mallow went on smoothly, "Up to now, trade between our two nations has suffered because of
    the restrictions placed upon our traders by your government. Surely, it has long been evident to
    you that unlimited trade-"

    "Free Trade!" mumbled the Commdor.

    "Free Trade, then. You must see that it would be of benefit to both of us. There are things you
    have that we want, and things we have that you want. It asks only an exchange to bring
    increased prosperity. An enlightened ruler such as yourself, a friend of the people - I might say,
    a member of the people - needs no elaboration on that theme. I won't insult your intelligence by
    offering any."

    "True! I have seen this. But what would you?" His voice was a plaintive whine. "Your people
    have always been so unreasonable. I am in favor of all the trade our economy can support, but
    not on your terms. I am not sole master here." His voice rose, "I am only the servant of public
    opinion. My people will not take commerce which carries with it a compulsory religion."

    Mallow drew himself up, "A compulsory religion?"

    "So it has always been in effect. Surely you remember the case of Askone twenty years ago.
    First they were sold some of your goods and then your people asked for complete freedom of
    missionary effort in order that the goods might be run properly; that Temples of Health be set
    up. There was then the establishment of religious schools; autonomous rights for all officers of
    the religion and with what result? Askone is now an integral member of the Foundation's
    system and the Grand Master cannot call his underwear his own. Oh, no! Oh, no! The dignity of
    an independent people could never suffer it."

    "None of what you speak is at all what I suggest," interposed Mallow.

    "No?"

    "No. I'm a Master Trader. Money is my religion. All this mysticism and hocus-pocus of the
    missionaries annoy me, and I'm glad you refuse to countenance it. It makes you more my type
    of man."

    The Commdor's laugh was high-pitched and jerky, "Well said! The Foundation should have
    sent a man of your caliber before this."

    He laid a friendly hand upon the trader's bulking shoulder, "But man, you have told me only
    half. You have told me what the catch is not. Now tell me what it is"

    "The only catch, Commdor, is that you're going to be burdened with an immense quantity of
    riches."



    "Indeed?" he snuffled. "But what could I want with riches? The true wealth is the love of one's
    people. I have that."

    "You can have both, for it is possible to gather gold with one hand and love with the other."

    "Now that, my young man, would be an interesting phenomenon, if it were possible. How would
    you go about it?"

    "Oh, in a number of ways. The difficulty is choosing among them. Let's see. Well, luxury items,
    for instance. This object here, now-"

    Mallow drew gently out of an inner pocket a flat, linked chain of polished metal. "This, for
    instance."

    "What is it?"

    "That's got to be demonstrated. Can you get a woman? Any young female will do. And a mirror,
    full length."

    "Hm-m-m. Let's get indoors, then."

    The Commdor referred to his dwelling place as a house. The populace undoubtedly would call
    it a palace. To Mallow's straightforward eyes, it looked uncommonly like a fortress, it was built
    on an eminence that overlooked the capital. Its walls were thick and reinforced. Its approaches
    were guarded, and its architecture was shaped for defense. Just the type of dwelling, Mallow
    thought sourly, for Asper, the Well-Beloved.

    A young girl was before them. She bent low to the Commdor, who said, "This is one of the
    Commdora's girls. Will she do?"

    "Perfectly!"

    The Commdor watched carefully while Mallow snapped the chain about the girl's waist, and
    stepped back.

    The Commdor snuffled, "Well. Is that all?"

    "Will you draw the curtain, Commdor. Young lady, there's a little knob just near the snap. Will
    you move it upward, please? Go ahead, it won't hurt you."

    The girl did so, drew a sharp breath, looked at her hands, and gasped, "Oh!"

    From her waist as a source she was drowned in a pale, streaming luminescence of shifting
    color that drew itself over her head in a flashing coronet of liquid fire. It was as if someone had
    tom the aurora borealis out of the sky and molded it into a cloak.

    The girl stepped to the mirror and stared, fascinated.

    "Here, take this." Mallow handed her a necklace of dull pebbles. "Put it around your neck."

    The girl did so, and each pebble, as it entered the luminescent field became an individual flame
    that leaped and sparkled in crimson and gold.



    "What do you think of it?" Mallow asked her. The girl didn't answer but there was adoration in
    her eyes. The Commdor gestured and reluctantly, she pushed the knob down, and the glory
    died. She left - with a memory.

    "It's yours, Commdor," said Mallow, "for the Commdora. Consider it a small gift from the
    Foundation."

    "Hm-m-m.' The Commdor turned the belt and necklace over in his hand as though calculating
    the weight. "How is it done?"

    Mallow shrugged, "That's a question for our technical experts. But it will work for you without -
    mark you, without- priestly help."

    "Well, it's only feminine frippery after all. What could you do with it? Where would the money
    come in?"

    "You have balls, receptions, banquets - that sort of thing?"

    "Oh, yes."

    "Do you realize what women will pay for that sort of jewelry? Ten thousand credits, at least."
    The Commdor seemed struck in a heap, "Ah!"

    "And since the power unit of this particular item will not last longer than six months, there will be
    the necessity of frequent replacements. Now we can sell as many of these as you want for the
    equivalent in wrought iron of one thousand credits. There's nine hundred percent profit for you."

    The Commdor plucked at his beard and seemed engaged in awesome mental calculations,
    "Galaxy, how they would fight for them. I'll keep the supply small and let them bid. Of course, it
    wouldn't do to let them know that I personally-"

    Mallow said, "We can explain the workings of dummy corporations, if you would like. -Then,
    working further at random, take our complete line of household gadgets. We have collapsible
    stoves that will roast the toughest meats to the desired tenderness in two minutes. We've got
    knives that won't require sharpening. We've got the equivalent of a complete laundry that can
    be packed in a small closet and will work entirely automatically. Ditto dish-washers. Ditto-ditto
    floor-scrubbers, furniture polishers, dust-precipitators, lighting fixtures - oh, anything you like.
    Think of your increased popularity, if you make them available to the public. Think of your
    increased quantity of, uh, worldly goods, if they're available as a government monopoly at nine
    hundred percent profit. It will be worth many times the money to them, and they needn't know
    what you pay for it. And, mind you, none of it will require priestly supervision. Everybody will be
    happy."

    "Except you, it seems. What do you get out of it?"

    "Just what every trader gets by Foundation law. My men and I will collect half of whatever
    profits we take in. Just you buy all I want to sell you, and we'll both make out quite well. Quite
    well."


    The Commdor was enjoying his thoughts, "What did you say you wanted to be paid with? Iron?



    "That, and coal, and bauxite. Also tobacco, pepper, magnesium, hardwood. Nothing you
    haven't got enough of."

    "It sounds well."

    "I think so. Oh, and still another item at random, Commdor. I could retool your factories."

    "Eh? How's that?"

    "Well, take your steel foundries. I have handy little gadgets that could do tricks with steel that
    would cut production costs to one percent of previous marks. You could cut prices by half, and
    still split extremely fat profits with the manufacturers. I tell you, I could show you exactly what I
    mean, if you allowed me a demonstration. Do you have a steel foundry in this city? It wouldn't
    take long."

    "It could be arranged, Trader Mallow. But tomorrow, tomorrow. Would you dine with us
    tonight?"

    "My men-" began Mallow.

    "Let them all come," said the Commdor, expansively. "A symbolic friendly union of our nations.
    It will give us a chance for further friendly discussion. But one thing," his face lengthened and
    grew stem, "none of your religion. Don't think that all this is an entering wedge for the
    missionaries."

    "Commdor," said Mallow, dryly, "I give you my word that religion would cut my profits."

    "Then that will do for now. You'll be escorted back to your ship."


    6 .

    The Commdora was much younger than her husband. Her face was pale and coldly formed
    and her black hair was drawn smoothly and tightly back.

    Her voice was tart. "You are quite finished, my gracious and noble husband? Quite, quite
    finished? I suppose I may even enter the garden if I wish, now."

    "There is no need for dramatics, Licia, my dear," said the Commdor, mildly. "The young man
    will attend at dinner tonight, and you can speak with him all you wish and even amuse yourself
    by listening to all I say. Room will have to be arranged for his men somewhere about the place.
    The stars grant that they be few in numbers."

    "Most likely they'll be great hogs of eaters who will eat meat by the quarter-animal and wine by
    the hogshead. And you will groan for two nights when you calculate the expense."

    "Well now, perhaps I won't. Despite your opinion, the dinner is to be on the most lavish scale."

    "Oh, I see." She stared at him contemptuously. "You are very friendly with these barbarians.
    Perhaps that is why I was not to be permitted to attend your conversation. Perhaps your little



    weazened soul is plotting to turn against my father."

    "Not at all."

    "Yes, I'd be likely to believe you, wouldn't I? If ever a poor woman was sacrificed for policy to
    an unsavory marriage, it was myself. I could have picked a more proper man from the alleys
    and mudheaps of my native world."

    "Well, now, I'll tell you what, my lady. Perhaps you would enjoy returning to your native world.
    Except that, to retain as a souvenir that portion of you with which I am best acquainted, I could
    have your tongue cut out first. And," he tolled his head, calculatingly, to one side, "as a final
    improving touch to your beauty, your ears and the tip of your nose as well."

    "You wouldn't dare, you little pug-dog. My father would pulverize your toy nation to meteoric
    dust. In fact, he might do it in any case, if I told him you were treating with these barbarians."

    "Hm-m-m. Well, there's no need for threats. You are free to question the man yourself tonight.
    Meanwhile, madam, keep your wagging tongue still."

    "At your orders?"

    "Here, take this, then, and keep still."

    The band was about her waist and the necklace around her neck. He pushed the knob himself
    and stepped back.

    The Commdora drew in her breath and held out her hands stiffly. She fingered the necklace
    gingerly, and gasped again.

    The Commdor rubbed his hands with satisfaction and said, "You may wear it tonight - and I'll
    get you more. Now keep still."

    The Commdora kept still.


    7 .

    Jaim Twer fidgeted and shuffled his feet. He said, "What's twisting yoi/rface?"

    Hober Mallow lifted out of his brooding, "Is my face twisted? It's not meant so."

    "Something must have happened yesterday, -I mean, besides that feast." With sudden
    conviction, "Mallow, there's trouble, isn't there?"

    "Trouble? No. Quite the opposite. In fact, I'm in the position of throwing my full weight against a
    door and finding it ajar at the time. We're getting into this steel foundry too easily."

    "You suspect a trap?"

    "Oh, for Seldon's sake, don't be melodramatic." Mallow swallowed his impatience and added
    conversationally, "It's just that the easy entrance means there will be nothing to see.



    "Nuclear power, huh?" Twer ruminated. "I'll tell you. There's just about no evidence of any
    nuclear power economy here in Korell. And it would be pretty hard to mask all signs of the
    widespread effects a fundamental technology such as nucleics would have on everything."

    "Not if it was just starting up, Twer, and being applied to a war economy. You'd find it in the
    shipyards and the steel foundries only."

    "So if we don't find it, then-"

    "Then they haven't got it - or they're not showing it. Toss a coin or take a guess."

    Twer shook his head, "I wish I'd been with you yesterday."

    "I wish you had, too," said Mallow stonily. "I have no objection to moral support. Unfortunately,
    it was the Commdor who set the terms of the meeting, and not myself. And what is coming now
    would seem to be the royal groundcar to escort us to the foundry. Have you got the gadgets?"


    "All of them."


    8 .

    The foundry was large, and bore the odor of decay which no amount of superficial repairs could
    quite erase. It was empty now and in quite an unnatural state of quiet, as it played
    unaccustomed host to the Commdor and his court.

    Mallow had swung the steel sheet onto the two supports with a careless heave. He had taken
    the instrument held out to him by Twer and was gripping the leather handle inside its leaden
    sheath.

    "The instrument," he said, "is dangerous, but so is a buzz saw. You just have to keep your
    fingers away."

    And as he spoke, he drew the muzzle-slit swiftly down the length of the steel sheet, which
    quietly and instantly fell in two.

    There was a unanimous jump, and Mallow laughed. He picked up one of the halves and
    propped it against his knee, "You can adjust the cutting-length accurately to a hundredth of an
    inch, and a two-inch sheet will slit down the middle as easily as this thing did. If you've got the
    thickness exactly judged, you can place steel on a wooden table, and split the metal without
    scratching the wood."

    And at each phrase, the nuclear shear moved and a gouged chunk of steel flew across the
    room.

    "That," he said, "is whittling - with steel."

    He passed back the shear. "Or else you have the plane. Do you want to decrease the thickness
    of a sheet, smooth out an irregularity, remove corrosion? Watch!"



    Thin, transparent foil flew off the other half of the original sheet in six-inch swarths, then
    eight-inch, then twelve.

    "Or drills? It's all the same principle."

    They were crowded around now. It might have been a sleight-of-hand show, a comer magician,
    a vaudeville act made into high-pressure salesmanship. Commdor Asper fingered scraps of
    steel. High officials of the government tiptoed over each other's shoulders, and whispered,
    while Mallow punched clean, beautiful round holes through an inch of hard steel at every touch
    of his nuclear drill.

    "Just one more demonstration. Bring two short lengths of pipe, somebody."

    An Honorable Chamberlain of something-or-other sprang to obedience in the general
    excitement and thought-absorption, and stained his hands like any laborer.

    Mallow stood them upright and shaved the ends off with a single stroke of the shear, and then
    joined the pipes, fresh cut to fresh cut.

    And there was a single pipe! The new ends, with even atomic irregularities missing, formed one
    piece upon joining.

    Then Mallow looked up at his audience, stumbled at his first word and stopped. There was the
    keen stirring of excitement in his chest, and the base of his stomach went tingly and cold.

    The Commdor's own bodyguard, in the confusion, had struggled to the front line, and Mallow,
    for the first time, was near enough to see their unfamiliar hand-weapons in detail.

    They were nuclear! There was no mistaking it; an explosive projectile weapon with a barrel like
    that was impossible. But that wasn't the big point. That wasn't the point at all.

    The butts of those weapons had, deeply etched upon them, in worn gold plating, the
    Spaceship-and-Sun!

    The same Spaceship-and-Sun that was stamped on every, one of the great volumes of the
    original Encyclopedia that the Foundation had begun and not yet finished. The same
    Spaceship-and-Sun that had blazoned the banner of the Galactic Empire through millennia.

    Mallow talked through and around his thoughts, "Test that pipe! It's one piece. Not perfect;
    naturally, the joining shouldn't be done by hand."

    There was no need of further legerdemain. It had gone over. Mallow was through. He had what
    he wanted. There was only one thing in his mind. The golden globe with its conventionalized
    rays, and the oblique cigar shape that was a space vessel.

    The Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire!

    The Empire! The words drilled! A century and a half had passed but there was still the-Empire,
    somewhere deeper in the Galaxy. And it was emerging again, out into the Periphery.


    Mallow smiled!



    9 .


    The Far Star was two days out in space, when Hober Mallow, in his private quarters with Senior
    Lieutenant Drawt, handed him an envelope, a roll of microfilm, and a silvery spheroid.

    "As of an hour from now, Lieutenant, you're Acting Captain of the Far Star, until I return, -or
    forever."

    Drawt made a motion of standing but Mallow waved him down imperiously.

    "Quiet, and listen. The envelope contains the exact location of the planet to which you're to
    proceed. There you will wait for me for two months. If, before the two months are up, the
    Foundation locates you, the microfilm is my report of the trip.

    "If, however," and his voice was somber, "I do not return at the end of two months, and
    Foundation vessels do not locate you, proceed to the planet, Terminus, and hand in the Time
    Capsule as the report. Do you understand that?"

    "Yes, sir."

    "At no time are you, or any of the men, to amplify in any single instance, my official report."

    "If we are questioned, sir?"

    "Then you know nothing."

    "Yes, sir."

    The interview ended, and fifty minutes later, a lifeboat kicked lightly off the side of the Far Star.


    10 .

    Onum Barr was an old man, too old to be afraid. Since the last disturbances, he had lived alone
    on the fringes of the land with what books he had saved from the ruins. Fie had nothing he
    feared losing, least of all the worn remnant of his life, and so he faced the intruder without
    cringing.

    "Your door was open," the stranger explained.

    His accent was clipped and harsh, and Barr did not fail to notice the strange blue-steel
    hand-weapon at his hip. In the half gloom of the small room, Barr saw the glow of a force-shield
    surrounding the man.

    He said, wearily, "There is no reason to keep it closed. Do you wish anything of me?"

    "Yes." The stranger remained standing in the center of the room. He was large, both in height
    and bulk. "Yours is the only house about here."

    "It is a desolate place," agreed Barr, "but there is a town to the east. I can show you the way'."



    "In awhile. May I sit?"

    "If the chairs will hold you," said the old man, gravely. They were old, too. Relics of a better
    youth.

    The stranger said, "My name is Hober Mallow. I come from a far province."

    Barr nodded and smiled, "Your tongue convicted you of that long ago. I am Onum Barr of
    Siwenna - and once Patrician of the Empire."

    "Then this is Siwenna. I had only old maps to guide me."

    "They would have to be old, indeed, for star-positions to be misplaced."

    Barr sat quite still, while the other's eyes drifted away into a reverie. He noticed that the nuclear
    force-shield had vanished from about the man and admitted dryly to himself that his person no
    longer seemed formidable to strangers - or even, for good or for evil, to his enemies.

    He said, "My house is poor and my resources few. You may share what I have if your stomach
    can endure black bread and dried corn."

    Mallow shook his head, "No, I have eaten, and I can't stay. All I need are the directions to the
    center of government."

    "That is easily enough done, and poor though I am, deprives me of nothing. Do you mean the
    capital of the planet, or of the Imperial Sector?"

    The younger man's eyes narrowed, "Aren't the two identical? Isn't this Siwenna?"

    The old patrician nodded slowly, "Siwenna, yes. But Siwenna is no longer capital of the
    Normannic Sector. Your old map has misled you after all. The stars may not change even in
    centuries, but political boundaries are all too fluid."

    "That's too bad. In fact, that's very bad. Is the new capital far off?"

    "It's on Orsha II. Twenty parsecs off. Your map will direct you. How old is it?"

    "A hundred and fifty years."

    "That old?" The old man sighed. "History has been crowded since. Do you know any of it?"
    Mallow shook his bead slowly.

    Barr said, "You're fortunate. It has been an evil time for the provinces, but for the reign of
    Stannell VI, and he died fifty years ago. Since that time, rebellion and ruin, ruin and rebellion."
    Barr wondered if he were growing garrulous. It was a lonely life out here, and he had so little
    chance to talk to men.

    Mallow said with sudden sharpness, "Ruin, eh? You sound as if the province were
    impoverished."

    "Perhaps not on an absolute scale. The physical resources of twenty-five first-rank planets take



    a long time to use up. Compared to the wealth of the last century, though, we have gone a long
    way downhill - and there is no sign of turning, not yet. Why are you so interested in all this,
    young man? You are all alive and your eyes shine!"

    The trader came near enough to blushing, as the faded eyes seemed to look too deep into his
    and smile at what they saw.

    He said, "Now look here. I'm a trader out there - out toward the rim of the Galaxy. I've located
    some old maps, and I'm out to open new markets. Naturally, talk of impoverished provinces
    disturbs me. You can't get money out of a world unless money's there to be got. Now how's
    Siwenna, for instance?"

    The old man leaned forward, "I cannot say. It will do even yet, perhaps. But you a trader? You
    look more like a fighting man. You hold your hand near your gun and there is a scar on your
    jawbone."

    Mallow jerked his head, "There isn't much law out there where I come from. Fighting and scars
    are part of a trader's overhead. But fighting is only useful when there's money at the end, and if
    I can get it without, so much the sweeter. Now will I find enough money here to make it worth
    the fighting? I take it I can find the fighting easily enough."

    "Easily enough," agreed Barr. "You could join Wiscard's remnants in the Red Stars. I don't
    know, though, if you'd call that fighting or piracy. Or you could join our present gracious viceroy
    - gracious by right of murder, pillage, rapine, and the word of a boy Emperor, since rightfully
    assassinated." The patrician's thin cheeks reddened. His eyes closed and then opened,
    bird-bright.

    "You don't sound very friendly to the viceroy, Patrician Barr," said Mallow. "What if I'm one of
    his spies?"

    "What if you are?" said Barr, bitterly. "What can you take?" He gestured a withered arm at the
    bare interior of the decaying mansion.

    "Your life."

    "It would leave me easily enough. It has been with me five years too long. But you are not one
    of the viceroy's men. If you were, perhaps even now instinctive self-preservation would keep
    my mouth closed."

    "How do you know?"

    The old man laughed, "You seem suspicious - Come, I'll wager you think I'm trying to trap you
    into denouncing the government. No, no. I am past politics."

    "Past politics? Is a man ever past that? The words you used to describe the viceroy - what
    were they? Murder, pillage, all that. You didn't sound objective. Not exactly. Not as if you were
    past politics."

    The old man shrugged, "Memories sting when they come suddenly. Listen! Judge for yourself!
    When Siwenna was the provincial capital, I was a patrician and a member of the provincial



    senate. My family was an old and honored one. One of my great-grandfathers had been- No,
    never mind that. Past glories are poor feeding."

    "I take it," said Mallow, "there was a civil war, or a revolution."

    Barr's face darkened. "Civil wars are chronic in these degenerate days, but Siwenna had kept
    apart. Under Stannell VI, it had almost achieved its ancient prosperity. But weak emperors
    followed, and weak emperors mean strong viceroys, and our last viceroy - the same Wiscard,
    whose remnants still prey on the commerce among the Red Stars - aimed at the Imperial
    Purple. He wasn't the first to aim. And if he had succeeded, he wouldn't have been the first to
    succeed.

    "But he failed. For when the Emperor's Admiral approached the province at the head of a fleet,
    Siwenna itself rebelled against its rebel viceroy." He stopped, sadly.

    Mallow found himself tense on the edge of his seat, and relaxed slowly, "Please continue, sir."

    "Thank you," said Barr, wearily. "It's kind of you to humor an old man. They rebelled; or I should
    say, we rebelled, for I was one of the minor leaders. Wiscard left Siwenna, barely ahead of us,
    and the planet, and with it the province, were thrown open to the admiral with every gesture of
    loyalty to the Emperor. Why we did this, -I'm not sure. Maybe we felt loyal to the symbol, if not
    the person, of the Emperor, -a cruel and vicious child. Maybe we feared the horrors of a siege."

    "Well?" urged Mallow, gently.

    "Well, came the grim retort, "that didn't suit the admiral. He wanted the glory of conquering a
    rebellious province and his men wanted the loot such conquest would involve. So while the
    people were still gathered in every large city, cheering the Emperor and his admiral, he
    occupied all armed centers, and then ordered the population put to the nuclear blast."

    "On what pretext?"

    "On the pretext that they had rebelled against their viceroy, the Emperor's anointed. And the
    admiral became the new viceroy, by virtue of one month of massacre, pillage and complete
    horror. I had six sons. Five died - variously. I had a daughter. I hope she died, eventually. /
    escaped because I was old. I came here, too old to cause even our viceroy worry." He bent his
    gray head, "They left me nothing, because I had helped drive out a rebellious governor and
    deprived an admiral of his glory."

    Mallow sat silent, and waited. Then, "What of your sixth son?" he asked softly.

    "Eh?" Barr smiled acidly. "He is safe, for he has joined the admiral as a common soldier under
    an assumed name. He is a gunner in the viceroy's personal fleet. Oh, no, I see your eyes. He is
    not an unnatural son. He visits me when he can and gives me what he can. He keeps me alive.
    And some day, our great and glorious viceroy will grovel to his death, and it will be my son who
    will be his executioner."

    "And you tell this to a stranger? You endanger your son."

    "No. I help him, by introducing a new enemy. And were I a friend of the viceroy, as I am his



    enemy, I would tell him to string outer space with ships, clear to the rim of the Galaxy."

    "There are no ships there?"

    "Did you find any? Did any space-guards question your entry? With ships few enough, and the
    bordering provinces filled with their share of intrigue and iniquity, none can be spared to guard
    the barbarian outer suns. No danger ever threatened us from the broken edge of the Galaxy,
    -until you came."

    "I? I'm no danger."

    "There will be more after you."

    Mallow shook his head slowly, "I'm not sure I understand you."

    "Listen!" There was a feverish edge to the old man's voice. "I knew you when you entered. You
    have a force-shield about your body, or had when I first saw you."

    Doubtful silence, then, "Yes, -I had."

    "Good. That was a flaw, but you didn't know that. There are some things I know. It's out of
    fashion in these decaying times to be a scholar. Events race and flash past and who cannot
    fight the tide with nuclear-blast in hand is swept away, as I was. But I was a scholar, and I know
    that in all the history of nucleics, no portable force-shield was ever invented. We have
    force-shields - huge, lumbering powerhouses that will protect a city, or even a ship, but not
    one, single man."

    "Ah?" Mallow's underlip thrust out. "And what do you deduce from that?"

    "There have been stories percolating through space. They travel strange paths and become
    distorted with every parsec, -but when I was young there was a small ship of strange men, who
    did not know our customs and could not tell where they came from. They talked of magicians at
    the edge of the Galaxy; magicians who glowed in the darkness, who flew unaided through the
    air, and whom weapons would not touch.

    "We laughed. I laughed, too. I forgot it till today. But you glow in the darkness, and I don't think
    my blaster, if I had one, would hurt you. Tell me, can you fly through air as you sit there now?"

    Mallow said calmly, "I can make nothing of all this."

    Barr smiled, "I'm content with the answer. I do not examine my guests. But if there are
    magicians; if you are one of them; there may some day be a great influx of them, or you.
    Perhaps that would be well. Maybe we need new blood." He muttered soundlessly to himself,
    then, slowly, "But it works the other way, too. Our new viceroy also dreams, as did our old
    Wiscard."

    "Also after the Emperor's crown?"

    Barr nodded, "My son hears tales. In the viceroy's personal entourage, one could scarcely help
    it. And he tells me of them. Our new viceroy would not refuse the Crown if offered, but he
    guards his line of retreat. There are stories that, failing Imperial heights, he plans to carve out a



    new Empire in the Barbarian hinterland. It is said, but I don't vouch for this, that he has already
    given one of his daughters as wife to a Kinglet somewhere in the uncharted Periphery."

    "If one listened to every story-"

    "I know. There are many more. I'm old and I babble nonsense. But what do you say?" And
    those sharp, old eyes peered deep.

    The trader considered, "I say nothing. But I'd like to ask something. Does Siwenna have
    nuclear power? Now, wait, I know that it possesses the knowledge of nucleics. I mean, do they
    have power generators intact, or did the recent sack destroy them?"

    "Destroy them? Oh, no. Half a planet would be wiped out before the smallest power station
    would be touched. They are irreplaceable and the suppliers of the strength of the fleet." Almost
    proudly, "We have the largest and best on this side of Trantor itself."

    "Then what would I do first if I wanted to see these generators?"

    "Nothing!" replied Barr, decisively. "You couldn't approach any military center without being
    shot down instantly. Neither could anyone. Siwenna is still deprived of civic rights."

    "You mean all the power stations are under the military?"

    "No. There are the small city stations, the ones supplying power for heating and lighting homes,
    powering vehicles and so forth. Those are almost as bad. They're controlled by the tech-men."

    "Who are they?"

    "A specialized group which supervises the power plants. The honor is hereditary, the young
    ones being brought up in the profession as apprentices. Strict sense of duty, honor, and all that.
    No one but a tech-man could enter a station."

    "I see."

    "I don't say, though," added Barr, "that there aren't cases where tech-men haven't been bribed.
    In days when we have nine emperors in fifty years and seven of these are assassinated, -when
    every space-captain aspires to the usurpation of a viceroyship, and every viceroy to the
    Imperium,

    I suppose even a tech-man can fall prey to money. But it would require a good deal, and I have
    none. Have you?"

    "Money? No. But does one always bribe with money?"

    "What else, when money buys all else."

    "There is quite enough that money won't buy. And now if you'll tell me the nearest city with one
    of the stations, and how best to get there, I'll thank you."

    "Wait!" Barr held out his thin hands. "Where do you rush? You come here, but / ask no
    questions. In the city, where the inhabitants are still called rebels, you would be challenged by
    the first soldier or guard who heard your accent and saw your clothes."



    He rose and from an obscure comer of an old chest brought out a booklet. "My passport,
    -forged. I escaped with it."

    He placed it in Mallow's hand and folded the fingers over it. "The description doesn't fit, but if
    you flourish it, the chances are many to one they will not look closely."

    "But you. You'll be left without one."

    The old exile shrugged cynically, "What of it? And a further caution. Curb your tongue! Your
    accent is barbarous, your idioms peculiar, and every once in a while you deliver yourself of the
    most astounding archaisms. The less you speak, the less suspicion you will draw upon
    yourself. Now I'll tell you how to get to the city-"

    Five minutes later, Mallow was gone.

    He returned but once, for a moment, to the old patrician's house, before leaving it entirely,
    however. And when Onum Barr stepped into his little garden early the next morning, he found a
    box at his feet. It contained provisions, concentrated provisions such as one would find aboard
    ship, and alien in taste and preparation.

    But they were good, and lasted long.


    11 .

    The tech-man was short, and his skin glistened with well-kept plumpness. His hair was a fringe
    and his skull shone through pinkly. The rings on his fingers were thick and heavy, his clothes
    were scented, and he was the first man Mallow had met on the planet who hadn't looked
    hungry.

    The tech-man's lips pursed peevishly, "Now, my man, quickly. I have things of great importance
    waiting for me. You seem a stranger-" He seemed to evaluate Mallow's definitely
    un-Siwennese costume and his eyelids were heavy with suspicion.

    "I am not of the neighborhood," said Mallow, calmly, "but the matter is irrelevant. I have had the
    honor to send you a little gift yesterday-"

    The tech-man's nose lifted, "I received it. An interesting gewgaw. I may have use for it on
    occasion."

    "I have other and more interesting gifts. Quite out of the gewgaw stage."

    "Oh-h?" The tech-man's voice lingered thoughtfully over the monosyllable. "I think I already see
    the course of the interview; it has happened before. You are going to give me some trifle or
    other. A few credits, perhaps a cloak, second-rate jewelry; anything your little soul may think
    sufficient to corrupt a tech-man." His lower lip puffed out belligerently, "And I know what you
    wish in exchange. There have been others and to spare with the same bright idea. You wish to
    be adopted into our clan. You wish to be taught the mysteries of nucleics and the care of the



    machines. You think because you dogs of Siwenna - and probably your strangerhood is
    assumed for safety's sake - are being daily punished for your rebellion that you can escape
    what you deserve by throwing over yourselves the privileges and protections of the tech-man's
    guild."

    Mallow would have spoken, but the tech-man raised himself into a sudden roar. "And now leave
    before I report your name to the Protector of the City. Do you think that I would betray the trust?
    The Siwennese traitors that preceded me would have - perhaps! But you deal with a different
    breed now. Why, Galaxy, I marvel that I do not kill you myself at this moment with my bare
    hands."

    Mallow smiled to himself. The entire speech was patently artificial in tone and content, so that
    all the dignified indignation degenerated into uninspired farce.

    The trader glanced humorously at the two flabby hands that had been named as his possible
    executioners then and there, and said, "Your Wisdom, you are wrong on three counts. First, I
    am not a creature of the viceroy come to test your loyalty. Second, my gift is something the
    Emperor himself in all his splendor does not and will never possess. Third, what I wish in return
    is very little; a nothing; a mere breath."

    "So you say!" He descended into heavy sarcasm. "Come, what is this imperial donation that
    your godlike power wishes to bestow upon me? Something the Emperor doesn't have, eh?" He
    broke into a sharp squawk of derision.

    Mallow rose and pushed the chair aside, "I have waited three days to see you, Your Wisdom,
    but the display will take only three seconds. If you will just draw that blaster whose butt I see
    very near your hand-"

    "Eh?"

    "And shoot me, I will be obliged."

    "What?”

    "If I am killed, you can tell the police I tried to bribe you into betraying guild secrets. You'll
    receive high praise. If I am not killed, you may have my shield."

    For the first time, the tech-man became aware of the dimly-white illumination that hovered
    closely about his visitor, as though he had been dipped in pearl-dust. His blaster raised to the
    level and with eyes a-squint in wonder and suspicion, he closed contact.

    The molecules of air caught in the sudden surge of atomic disruption, tore into glowing, burning
    ions, and marked out the blinding thin line that struck at Mallow's heart - and splashed!

    While Mallow's look of patience never changed, the nuclear forces that tore at him consumed
    themselves against that fragile, pearly illumination, and crashed back to die in mid-air.

    The tech-man's blaster dropped to the floor with an unnoticed crash.

    Mallow said, "Does the Emperor have a personal force-shield? You can have one."



    The tech-man stuttered, "Are you a tech-man?"

    "No."

    "Then - then where did you get that?"

    "What do you care?" Mallow was coolly contemptuous. "Do you want it?" A thin, knobbed chain
    fell upon the desk, "There it is."

    The tech-man snatched it up and fingered it nervously, "Is this complete?"

    "Complete."

    "Where's the power?"

    Mallow's finger fell upon the largest knob, dull in its leaden case.

    The tech-man looked up, and his face was congested with blood, "Sir, I am a tech-man, senior
    grade. I have twenty years behind me as supervisor and I studied under the great Bier at the
    University of Trantor. If you have the infernal charlatanry to tell me that a small container the
    size of a - of a walnut, blast it, holds a nuclear generator, I'll have you before the Protector in
    three seconds."

    "Explain it yourself then, if you can. I say it's complete."

    The tech-man's flush faded slowly as he bound the chain about his waist, and, following
    Mallow's gesture, pushed the knob. The radiance that surrounded him shone into dim relief. His
    blaster lifted, then hesitated. Slowly, he adjusted it to an almost burnless minimum.

    And then, convulsively, he closed circuit and the nuclear fire dashed against his hand,
    harmlessly.

    .He whirled, "And what if I shoot you now, and keep the shield."

    "Try!" said Mallow. "Do you think I gave you my only sample?" And he, too, was solidly incased
    in light.

    The tech-man giggled nervously. The blaster clattered onto the desk. He said, "And what is this
    mere nothing, this breath, that you wish in return'?"

    "I want to see your generators."

    "You realize that that is forbidden. It would mean ejection into space for both of us-"

    "I don't want to touch them or have anything to do with them. I want to see them - from a
    distance."

    "If not?"

    "If not, you have your shield, but I have other things. For one thing, a blaster especially
    designed to pierce that shield."

    "Hm-m-m." The tech-man's eyes shifted. "Come with me."



    12 .


    The tech-man's home was a small two-story affair on the Outskirts of the huge, cubiform,
    windowless affair that dominated the center of the city. Mallow passed from one to the other
    through an underground passage, and found himself in the silent, ozone-tinged atmosphere of
    the powerhouse.

    For fifteen minutes, he followed his guide and said nothing. His eyes missed nothing. His
    fingers touched nothing. And then, the tech-man said in strangled tones, "Have you had
    enough? I couldn't trust my underlings in this case."

    "Could you ever?" asked Mallow, ironically. "I've had enough."

    They were back in the office and Mallow said, thoughtfully, "And all those generators are in
    your hands?"

    "Every one," said the tech-man, with more than a touch of complacency.

    "And you keep them running and in order?"

    "Right!"

    "And if they break down?"

    The tech-man shook his head indignantly, "They don't break down. They never break down.
    They were built for eternity."

    "Eternity is a long time. Just suppose-"

    "It is unscientific to suppose meaningless cases."

    "All right. Suppose I were to blast a vital part into nothingness? I suppose the machines aren't
    immune to nuclear forces? Suppose I fuse a vital connection, or smash a quartz D-tube?"

    "Well, then," shouted the tech-man, furiously, "you would be killed."

    "Yes, I know that," Mallow was shouting, too, "but what about the generator? Could you repair
    it?"

    "Sir," the tech-man howled his words, "you have had a fair return. You've had what you asked
    for. Now get out! I owe you nothing more!"

    Mallow bowed with a satiric respect and left.

    Two days later he was back where the Far Star waited to return with him to the planet,
    Terminus.

    And two days later, the tech-man's shield went dead, and for all his puzzling and cursing never
    glowed again.



    13 .


    Mallow relaxed for almost the first time in six months. He was on his back in the sunroom of his
    new house, stripped to the skin. His great, brown arms were thrown up and out, and the
    muscles tautened into a stretch, then faded into repose.

    The man beside him placed a cigar between Mallow's teeth and lit it. He champed on one of his
    own and said, "You must be overworked. Maybe you need a long rest."

    "Maybe I do, Jael, but I'd rather rest in a council seat. Because I'm going to have that seat, and
    you're going to help me."

    Ankor Jael raised his eyebrows and said, "How did I get into this?"

    "You got in obviously. Firstly, you're an old dog of a politico. Secondly, you were booted out of
    your cabinet seat by Jorane Sutt, the same fellow who'd rather lose an eyeball than see me in
    the council. You don't think much of my chances, do you?"

    "Not much," agreed the ex-Minister of Education. "You're a Smyrnian."

    "That's no legal bar. I've had a lay education."

    "Well, come now. Since when does prejudice follow any law but its own. Now, how about your
    own man - this Jaim Twer? What does he say?"

    "He spoke about running me for council almost a year ago," replied Mallow easily, "but I've
    outgrown him. He couldn't have pulled it off in any case. Not enough depth. He's loud and
    forceful - but that's only an expression of nuisance value. I'm off to put over a real coup. I need
    you."

    "Jorane Sutt is the cleverest politician on the planet and he'll be against you. I don't claim to be
    able to outsmart him. And don't think he doesn't fight hard, and dirty."

    "I've got money."

    "Mat helps. But it takes a lot to buy off prejudice, you dirty Smyrnian."

    "I'll have a lot."

    "Well, I'll look into the matter. But don't ever you crawl up on your hind legs and bleat that I
    encouraged you in the matter. Who's that?"

    Mallow pulled the corners of his mouth down, and said, "Jorane Sutt himself, I think. He's early,
    and I can understand it. I’ve been dodging him for a month. Look, Jael, get into the next room,
    and turn the speaker on low. I want you to listen."

    He helped the council member out of the room with a shove of his bare foot, then scrambled up
    and into a silk robe. The synthetic sunlight faded to normal power.

    The secretary to the mayor entered stiffly, while the solemn major-domo tiptoed the door shut
    behind him.



    Mallow fastened his belt and said, "Take your choice of chairs, Sutt."

    Sutt barely cracked a flickering smile. The chair he chose was comfortable but he did not relax
    into it. From its edge, he said, "If you'll state your terms to begin with, we'll get down to
    business."

    "What terms?"

    "You wish to be coaxed? Well, then, what, for instance, did you do at Korell? Your report was
    incomplete."

    "I gave it to you months ago. You were satisfied then."

    Yes," Sutt rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with one finger, "but since then your activities have
    been significant. We know a good deal of what you're doing, Mallow. We know, exactly, how
    many factories you're putting up; in what a hurry you're doing it; and how much it's costing you.
    And there's this palace you have," he gazed about him with a cold lack of appreciation, "which
    set you back considerably more than my annual salary; and a swathe you've been cutting - a
    very considerable and expensive swathe - through the upper layers of Foundation society."

    "So? Beyond proving that you employ capable spies, what does it show?"

    "It shows you have money you didn't have a year ago. And that can show anything - for
    instance, that a good deal went on at Korell that we know nothing of. Where are you getting
    your money?"

    "My dear Sutt, you can't really expect me to tell you."

    "I don't."

    "I didn't think you did. That's why I'm going to tell you. It's straight from the treasure-chests of
    the Commdor of Korell."

    Sutt blinked.

    Mallow smiled and continued. "Unfortunately for you, the money is quite legitimate. I'm a Master
    Trader and the money I received was a quantity of wrought iron and chromite in exchange for a
    number of trinkets I was able to supply him with. Fifty per cent of the profit is mine by
    hidebound contract with the Foundation. The other half goes to the government at the end of
    the year when all good citizens pay their income tax."

    "There was no mention of any trade agreement in your report."

    "Nor was there any mention of what I had for breakfast that day, or the name of my current
    mistress, or any other irrelevant detail." Mallow's smile was fading into a sneer. "I was sent - to
    quote yourself - to keep my eyes open. They were never, shut. You wanted to find out what
    happened to the captured Foundation merchant ships. I never saw or heard of them. You
    wanted to find out if Korell had nuclear power. My report tells of nuclear blasters in the
    possession of the Commdor's private bodyguard. I saw no other signs. And the blasters I did
    see are relics of the old Empire, and may be show-pieces that do not work, for all my
    knowledge.



    "So far, I followed orders, but beyond that I was, and. still am, a free agent. According to the
    laws of the Foundation, a Master Trader may open whatever new markets he can, and receive
    therefrom his due half of the profits. What are your objections? I don't see them."

    Sutt bent his eyes carefully towards the wall and spoke with a difficult lack of anger, "It is the
    general custom of all traders to advance the religion with their trade."

    "I adhere to law, and not to custom."

    "There are times when custom can be the higher law."

    "Then appeal to the courts."

    Sutt raised somber eyes which seemed to retreat into their sockets. "You're a Smyrnian after
    all. It seems naturalization and education can't wipe out the taint in the blood. Listen, and try to
    understand, just the same.

    "This goes beyond money, or markets. We have the science of the great Hari Seldon to prove
    that upon us depends the future empire of the Galaxy, and from the course that leads to that
    Imperium we cannot turn. The religion we have is our all-important instrument towards that end.
    With it we have brought the Four Kingdoms under our control, even at the moment when they
    would have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which to control men and
    worlds.

    "The primary reason for the development of trade and traders was to introduce and spread this
    religion more quickly, and to insure that the introduction of new techniques and a new economy
    would be subject to our thorough and intimate control."

    Fie paused for breath, and Mallow interjected quietly, "I know the theory. I understand it
    entirely."

    "Do you? It is more than I expected. Then you see, of course, that your attempt at trade for its
    own sake; at mass production of worthless gadgets, which can only affect a world's economy
    superficially; at the subversion of interstellar policy to the god of profits; at the divorce of
    nuclear power from our controlling religion - can only end with the overthrow and complete
    negation of the policy that has worked successfully for a century."

    "And time enough, too," said Mallow, indifferently, "for a policy outdated, dangerous and
    impossible. Flowever well your religion has succeeded in the Four Kingdoms, scarcely another
    world in the Periphery has accepted it. At the time we seized control of the Kingdoms, there
    were a sufficient number of exiles, Galaxy knows, to spread the story of how Salvor Hardin
    used the priesthood and the superstition of the people to overthrow the independence and
    power of the secular monarchs. And if that wasn't enough, the case of Askone two decades
    back made it plain enough. There isn't a ruler in the Periphery now that wouldn't sooner cut his
    own throat than let a priest of the Foundation enter the territory.

    "I don't propose to force Korell or any other world to accept something I know they don't want.
    No, Sutt. If nuclear power makes them dangerous, a sincere friendship through trade will be
    many times better than an insecure overlordship, based on the hated supremacy of a foreign



    spiritual power, which, once it weakens ever so slightly, can only fall entirely and leave nothing
    substantial behind except an immortal fear and hate."

    Suit said cynically, "Very nicely put. So, to get back to the original point of discussion, what are
    your terms? What do you require to exchange your ideas for mine?"

    "You think my convictions are for sale?"

    "Why not?" came the cold response. "Isn't that your business, buying and selling?"

    "Only at a profit," said Mallow, unoffended. "Can you offer me more than I'm getting as is?"
    "You could have three-quarters of your trade profits, rather than half."

    Mallow laughed shortly, "A fine offer. The whole of the trade on your terms would fall far below
    - a tenth share on mine. Try harder than that."

    "You could have a council seat."

    "I'll have that anyway, without and despite you."

    With a sudden movement, Sutt clenched his fist, "You could also save yourself a prison term.
    Of twenty years, if I have my way. Count the profit in that."

    "No profit at all, but can you fulfill such a threat?"

    "How about a trial for murder?"

    "Whose murder?" asked Mallow, contemptuously.

    Sutt's voice was harsh now, though no louder than before, "The murder of an Anacreonian
    priest, in the service of the Foundation."

    "Is that so now? And what's your evidence?"

    The secretary to the mayor leaned forward, "Mallow, I'm not bluffing. The preliminaries are
    over. I have only to sign one final paper and the case of the Foundation versus Hober Mallow,
    Master Trader, is begun. You abandoned a subject of the Foundation to torture and death at
    the hands of an alien mob, Mallow, and you have only five seconds to prevent the punishment
    due you. For myself, I'd rather you decided to bluff it out. You'd be safer as a destroyed enemy,
    than as a doubtfully-converted friend."

    Mallow said solemnly, "You have your wish."

    "Good!" and the secretary smiled savagely. "It was the mayor who wished the preliminary
    attempt at compromise, not I. Witness that I did not try too hard."

    The door opened before him, and he left.

    Mallow looked up as Ankor Jael re-entered the room.

    Mallow said, "Did you hear him?"



    The politician flopped to the floor. "I never heard him as angry as that, since I've known the
    snake."

    "All right. What do you make of it?"

    "Well, I'll tell you. A foreign policy of domination through spiritual means is his idee fixe, but it's
    my notion that his ultimate aims aren't spiritual. I was fired out of the Cabinet for arguing on the
    same issue, as I needn't tell you."

    "You needn't. And what are those unspiritual aims according to your notion?"

    Jael grew serious, "Well, he's not stupid, so he must see the bankruptcy of our religious policy,
    which has hardly made a single conquest for us in seventy years. He's obviously using it for
    purposes of his own.

    "Now any dogma primarily based on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerous weapon to use on
    others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee that the weapon will never be turned on the
    user. For a hundred years now, we've supported a ritual and mythology that is becoming more
    and more venerable, traditional - and immovable. In some ways, it isn't under our control any
    more."

    "In what ways?" demanded Mallow. "Don't stop. I want your thoughts."

    "Well, suppose one man, one ambitious man, uses the force of religion against us, rather than
    for us."

    "You mean Sutt-"

    "You're right. I mean Sutt. Listen, man, if he could mobilize the various hierarchies on the
    subject planets against the Foundation in the name of orthodoxy, what chance would we
    stand? By planting himself at the head of the standards of the pious, he could make war on
    heresy, as represented by you, for instance, and make himself king eventually. After all, it was
    Hardin who said: 'A nuclear blaster is a good weapon, but it can point both ways.'"

    Mallow slapped his bare thigh, "All right, Jael, then get me in that council, and I'll fight him."

    Jael paused, then said significantly, "Maybe not. What was all that about having a priest
    lynched? Is isn't true, is it?"

    "It's true enough," Mallow said, carelessly.

    Jael whistled, "Has he definite proof?"

    "He should have." Mallow hesitated, then added, "Jaim Twer was his man from the beginning,
    though neither of them knew that I knew that. And Jaim Twer was an eyewitness."

    Jael shook his head. "Uh-uh. That's bad."

    "Bad? What's bad about it? That priest was illegally upon the planet by the Foundation's own
    laws. He was obviously used by the Korellian government as a bait, whether involuntary or not.
    By all the laws of common-sense, I had no choice but one action - and that action was strictly



    within the law. If he brings me to trial, he'll do nothing but make a prime fool of himself."

    And Jael shook his head again, "No, Mallow, you've missed it. I told you he played dirty. He's
    not out to convict you; he knows he can't do that. But he is out to ruin your standing with the
    people. You heard what he said. Custom is higher than law, at times. You could walk out of the
    trial scot-free, but if the people think you threw a priest to the dogs, your popularity is gone.

    "They'll admit you did the legal thing, even the sensible thing. But just the same you'll have
    been, in their eyes, a cowardly dog, an unfeeling brute, a hard-hearted monster. And you would
    never get elected to the council. You might even lose your rating as Master Trader by having
    your citizenship voted away from you. You're not native born, you know. What more do you
    think Sutt can want?" Mallow frowned stubbornly, "So!" "My boy," said Jael. "I'll stand by you,
    but / can't help. You're on the spot, -dead center."


    14 .

    The council chamber was full in a very literal sense on the fourth day of the trial of Hober
    Mallow, Master Trader. The only councilman absent was feebly cursing the fractured skull that
    had bedridden him. The galleries were filled to the aisleways and ceilings with those few of the
    crowd who by influence, wealth, or sheer diabolic perseverance had managed to get in. The
    rest filled the square outside, in swarming knots about the open-air trimensional 'visors.

    Ankor Jael made his way into the chamber with the near-futile aid and exertions of the police
    department, and then through the scarcely smaller confusion within to Hober Mallow's seat.

    Mallow turned with relief, "By Seldon, you cut it thin. Have you got it?"

    "Here, take it," said Jael. "It's everything you asked for."

    "Good. How are they taking it outside?"

    "They're wild clear through." Jael stirred uneasily, "You should never have allowed public
    hearings. You could have stopped them."

    "I didn't want to."

    "There's lynch talk. And Publis Manlio's men on the outer planets-"

    "I wanted to ask you about that, Jael. He's stirring up the Hierarchy against me, is he?"

    "Is he? It's the sweetest setup you ever saw, As Foreign Secretary, he handles the prosecution
    in a case of interstellar law. As High Priest and Primate of the Church, he rouses the fanatic
    hordes-"

    "Well, forget it. Do you remember that Hardin quotation you threw at me last month? We'll show
    them that the nuclear blaster can point both ways."

    The mayor was taking his seat now and the council members were rising in respect.

    Mallow whispered, "It's my turn today. Sit here and watch the fun."



    The day's proceedings began and fifteen minutes later, Hober Mallow stepped through a hostile
    whisper to the empty space before the mayor's bench. A lone beam of light centered upon him
    and in the public 'visors of the city, as well as on the myriads of private 'visors in almost every
    home of the Foundation's planets, the lonely giant figure of a man stared out defiantly.

    He began easily and quietly, "To save time, I will admit the truth of every point made against
    me by the prosecution. The story of the priest and the mob as related by them is perfectly
    accurate in every detail."

    There was a stirring in the chamber and a triumphant mass-snarl from the gallery. He waited
    patiently for silence.

    "However, the picture they presented fell short of completion. I ask the privilege of supplying
    the completion in my own fashion. My story may seem irrelevant at first. I ask your indulgence
    for that."

    Mallow made no reference to the notes before him.

    "I begin at the same time as the prosecution did; the day of my meeting with Jorane Sutt and
    Jaim Twer. What went on at those meetings you know. The conversations have been
    described, and to that description I have nothing to add - except my own thoughts of that day.

    "They were suspicious thoughts, for the events of that day were queer. Consider. Two people,
    neither of whom I knew more than casually, make unnatural and somewhat unbelievable
    propositions to me. One, the secretary to the mayor, asks me to play the part of intelligence
    agent to the government in a highly confidential matter, the nature and importance of which has
    already been explained to you. The other, self-styled leader of a political party, asks me to run
    for a council seat.

    "Naturally I looked for the ulterior motive. Sutt's seemed evident. He didn't trust me. Perhaps he
    thought I was selling nuclear power to enemies and plotting rebellion. And perhaps he was
    forcing the issue, or thought he was. In that case, he would need a man of his own near me on
    my proposed mission, as a spy. The last thought, however, did not occur to me until later on,
    when Jaim Twer came on the scene.

    "Consider again: Twer presents himself as a trader, retired into politics, yet I know of no details
    of his trading career, although my knowledge of the field is immense. And further, although
    Twer boasted of a lay education, he had never heard of a Seldon crisis."

    Hober Mallow waited to let the significance sink in and was rewarded with the first silence he
    had yet encountered, as the gallery caught its collective breath. That was for the inhabitants of
    Terminus itself. The men of the Outer Planets could hear only censored versions that would
    suit the requirements of religion. They would hear nothing of Seldon crises. But there would be
    further strokes they would not miss.

    Mallow continued:

    "Who here can honestly state that any man with a lay education can possibly be ignorant of the
    nature of a Seldon crisis? There is only one type of education upon the Foundation that



    excludes all mention of the planned history of Seldon and deals only with the man himself as a
    semi-mythical wizard-

    "I knew at that instant that Jaim Twer had never been a trader. I knew then that he was in holy
    orders and perhaps a full-fledged priest; and, doubtless, that for the three years he had
    pretended to head a political party of the traders, he had been a bought man of Jorane Sutt.

    "At the moment, I struck in the dark. I did not know Sun's purposes with regard to myself, but
    since he seemed to be feeding me rope liberally, I handed him a few fathoms of my own. My
    notion was that Twer was to be with me on my voyage as unofficial guardian on behalf of
    Jorane Sutt. Well, if he didn't get on, I knew well there'd be other devices waiting - and those
    others I might not catch in time. A known enemy is relatively safe. I invited Twer to come with
    me. He accepted.

    "That, gentlemen of the council, explains two things. First, it tells you that Twer is not a friend of
    mine testifying against me reluctantly and for conscience' sake, as the prosecution would have
    you believe. He is a spy, performing his paid job. Secondly, it explains a certain action of mine
    on the occasion of the first appearance of the priest whom I am accused of having murdered -
    an action as yet unmentioned, because unknown."

    Now there was a disturbed whispering in the council. Mallow cleared his throat theatrically, and
    continued:

    "I hate to describe my feelings when I first heard that we had a refugee missionary on board. I
    even hate to remember them. Essentially, they consisted of wild uncertainty. The event struck
    me at the moment as a move by Sutt, and passed beyond my comprehension or calculation. I
    was at sea - and completely.

    "There was one thing I could do. I got rid of Twer for five minutes by sending him after my
    officers. In his absence, I set up a Visual Record receiver, so that whatever happened might be
    preserved for future study. This was in the hope, the wild but earnest hope, that what confused
    me at the time might become plain upon review.

    "I have gone over that Visual Record some fifty times since. I have it here with me now, and will
    repeat the job a fifty-first time in your presence right now."

    The mayor pounded monotonously for order, as the chamber lost its equilibrium and the gallery
    roared. In five million homes on Terminus, excited observers crowded their receiving sets more
    closely, and at the prosecutor's own bench, Jorane Sutt shook his head coldly at the nervous
    high priest, while his eyes blazed fixedly on Mallow's face.

    The center of the chamber was cleared, and the lights burnt low. Ankor Jael, from his bench on
    the left, made the adjustments, and with a preliminary click, a holographic scene sprang to
    view; in color, in three-dimensions, in every attribute of life but life itself.

    There was the missionary, confused and battered, standing between the lieutenant and the
    sergeant. Mallow's image waited silently, and then men filed in, Twer bringing up the rear.

    The conversation played itself out, word for word. The sergeant was disciplined, and the
    missionary was questioned. The mob appeared, their growl could be heard, and the Revered



    Jord Parma made his wild appeal. Mallow drew his gun, and the missionary, as he was
    dragged away, lifted his arms in a mad, final curse and a tiny flash of light came and went.

    The scene ended, with the officers frozen at the horror of the situation, while Twer clamped
    shaking hands over his ears, and Mallow calmly put his gun away.

    The lights were on again; the empty space in the center of the floor was no longer even
    apparently full. Mallow, the real Mallow of the present, took up the burden of his narration:

    "The incident, you see, is exactly as the prosecution has presented it - on the surface. I'll
    explain that shortly. Jaim Twer's emotions through the whole business shows clearly a priestly
    education, by the way.

    "It was on that same day that I pointed out certain incongruities in the episode to Twer. I asked
    him where the missionary came from in the midst of the near-desolate tract we occupied at the
    time. I asked further where the gigantic mob had come from with the nearest sizable town a
    hundred miles away. The prosecution has paid no attention to such problems.

    "Or to other points; for instance, the curious point of Jord Parma's blatant conspicuousness. A
    missionary on Korell, risking his life in defiance of both Korellian and Foundation law, parades
    about in a very new and very distinctive priestly costume. There's something wrong there. At
    the time, I suggested that the missionary was an unwitting accomplice of the Commdor, who
    was using him in an attempt to force us into an act of wildly illegal aggression, to justify, in law,
    his subsequent destruction of our ship and of us.

    "The prosecution has anticipated this justification of my actions. They have expected me to
    explain that the safety of my ship, my crew, my mission itself were at stake and could not be
    sacrificed for one man, when that man would, in any case, have been destroyed, with us or
    without us. They reply by muttering about the Foundation's 'honor' and the necessity of
    upholding our 'dignity' in order to maintain our ascendancy.

    "For some strange reason, however, the prosecution has neglected Jord Parma himself, -as an
    individual. They brought out no details concerning him; neither his birthplace, nor his education,
    nor any detail of previous history. The explanation of this will also explain the incongruities I
    have pointed out in the Visual Record you have just seen. The two are connected.

    "The prosecution has advanced no details concerning Jord Parma because it cannot. That
    scene you saw by Visual Record seemed phoney because Jord Parma was phoney. There
    never was a Jord Parma. This whole trial is the biggest farce ever cooked up over an issue that
    never existed. "

    Once more he had to wait for the babble to die down. Fie said, slowly:

    "I'm going to show you the enlargement of a single still from the Visual Record. It will speak for
    itself. Lights again, Jael."

    The chamber dimmed, and the empty air filled again with frozen figures in ghostly, waxen
    illusion. The officers of the Far Star struck their stiff, impossible attitudes. A gun pointed from
    Mallow's rigid hand. At his left, the Revered Jord Parma, caught in mid-shriek, stretched his
    claws upward, while the failing sleeves hung halfway.



    And from the missionary's hand there was that little gleam that in the previous showing had
    flashed and gone. It was a permanent glow now.

    "Keep your eye on that light on his hand," called Mallow from the shadows. "Enlarge that
    scene, Jael!"

    The tableau bloated quickly. Outer portions fell away as the missionary drew towards the center
    and became a giant. Then there was only a hand and an arm, and then only a hand, which
    filled everything and remained there in immense, hazy tautness.

    The light had become a set of fuzzy, glowing letters: K S P.

    "That," Mallow's voice boomed out, "is a sample of tatooing, gentlemen. Under ordinary light it
    is invisible, but under ultraviolet light - with which I flooded the room in taking this Visual
    Record, it stands out in high relief. I'll admit it is a naive method of secret identification, but it
    works on Korell, where UV light is not to be found on street comers. Even in our ship, detection
    was accidental.

    "Perhaps some of you have already guessed what K S P stands for. Jord Parma knew his
    priestly lingo well and did his job magnificently. Where he had learned it, and how, I cannot say,
    but K S P stands for 'Korellian Secret Police.'"

    Mallow shouted over the tumult, roaring against the noise, "I have collateral proof in the form of
    documents brought from Korell, which I can present to the council if required.

    "And where is now the prosecution's case? They have already made and re-made the
    monstrous suggestion that I should have fought for the missionary in defiance of the law, and
    sacrificed my mission, my ship, and myself to the 'honor' of the Foundation.

    "But to do it for an impostor?

    "Should I have done it then for a Korellian secret agent tricked out in the robes and verbal
    gymnastics probably borrowed of an Anacreonian exile? Would Jorane Sutt and Publis Manlio
    have had me fall into a stupid, odious trap-"

    His hoarsened voice faded into the featureless background of a shouting mob. He was being
    lifted onto shoulders, and carried to the mayor's bench. Out the windows, he could see a torrent
    of madmen swarming into the square to add to the thousands there already.

    Mallow looked about for Ankor Jael, but it was impossible to find any single face in the
    incoherence of the mass. Slowly he became aware of a rhythmic, repeated shout, that was
    spreading from a small beginning, and pulsing into insanity:

    "Long live Mallow - long live Mallow - long live Mallow-"


    15 .

    Ankor Jael blinked at Mallow out of a haggard face. The last two days had been mad, sleepless



    ones.


    "Mallow, you've put on a beautiful show, so don't spoil it by jumping too high. You can't
    seriously consider running for mayor. Mob enthusiasm is a powerful thing, but it's notoriously
    fickle." '

    "Exactly!" said Mallow, grimly, "so we must coddle it, and the best way to do that is to continue
    the show."

    "Now what?"

    "You're to have Publis Manlio and Jorane Sutt arrested-"


    "What!"

    "Just what you hear. Have the mayor arrest them! I don't care what threats you use. I control
    the mob, -for today, at any rate. He won't dare face them."

    "But on what charge, man?"

    "On the obvious one. They've been inciting the priesthood of the outer planets to take sides in
    the factional quarrels of the Foundation. That's illegal, by Seldon. Charge them with
    'endangering the state.' And I don't care about a conviction any more than they did in my case.
    Just get them out of circulation until I'm mayor."

    "It's half a year till election."

    "Not too long!" Mallow was on his feet, and his sudden grip of Jael's arm was tight. "Listen, I'd
    seize the government by force if I had to - the way Salvor Hardin did a hundred years ago.
    There's still that Seldon crisis coming up, and when it comes I have to be mayor and high
    priest. Both I"


    Jael's brow furrowed. He said, quietly, "What's it going to be? Korell, after all?"

    Mallow nodded, "Of course. They'll declare war, eventually, though I'm betting it'll take another
    pair of years."

    "With nuclear ships?"

    "What do you think? Those three merchant ships we lost in their space sector weren't knocked
    over with compressed-air pistols. Jael, they're getting ships from the Empire itself. Don't open
    your mouth like a fool. I said the Empire! It's still there, you know. It many be gone here in the
    Periphery but in the Galactic center it's still very much alive. And one false move means that it,
    itself, may be on our neck. That's why I must be mayor and high priest. I'm the only man who
    knows how to fight the crisis."

    Jael swallowed dryly, "How? What are you going to do?"



    "Nothing."

    Jael smiled uncertainly, "Really! All of that!"

    But Mallow's answer was incisive, "When I'm boss of this Foundation, I'm going to do nothing.
    One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secret of this crisis."


    16 .

    Asper Argo, the Well-Beloved, Commdor of the Korellian Republic greeted his wife's entry by a
    hangdog lowering of his scanty eyebrows. To her at least, his self-adopted epithet did not
    apply. Even he knew that.

    She said, in a voice as sleek as her hair and as cold as her eyes, "My gracious lord, I
    understand, has finally come to a decision upon the fate of the Foundation upstarts."

    "Indeed?" said the Commdor, sourly. "And what more does your versatile understanding
    embrace?"

    "Enough, my very noble husband. You had another of your vacillating consultations with your
    councilors. Fine advisors." With infinite scorn, "A herd of palsied purblind idiots hugging their
    sterile profits close to their sunken chests in the face of my father's displeasure."

    "And who, my dear," was the mild response, "is the excellent source from which your
    understanding understands all this?"

    The Commdora laughed shortly, "If I told you, my source would be more corpse than source."

    "Well, you'll have your own way, as always." The Commdor shrugged and turned away. "And
    as for your father's displeasure: I much fear me it extends to a niggardly refusal to supply more
    ships."

    "More ships!" She blazed away, hotly, "And haven't you five? Don't deny it. I know you have
    five; and a sixth is promised."

    "Promised for the last year."

    "But one - just one - can blast that Foundation into stinking rubble. Just one! One, to sweep
    their little pygmy boats out of space."

    "I couldn't attack their planet, even with a dozen."

    "And how long would their planet hold out with their trade ruined, and their cargoes of toys and
    trash destroyed?" "Those toys and trash mean money," he sighed. "A good deal of money."

    "But if you had the Foundation itself, would you not have all it contained'? And if you had my
    father's respect and gratitude, would you not have more than ever the Foundation could give
    you? It's been three years - more - since that barbarian came with his magic sideshow. It's
    long enough."



    "My dear!" The Commdor turned and faced her. "I am growing old. I am weary. I lack the
    resilience to withstand your rattling mouth. You say you know that I have decided. Well, I have.
    It is over, and there is war between Korell and the Foundation."

    "Well!" The Commdora's figure expanded and her eyes sparkled, "You learned wisdom at last,
    though in your dotage. And now when you are master of this hinterland, you may be sufficiently
    respectable to be of some weight and importance in the Empire. For one thing, we might leave
    this barbarous world and attend the viceroy's court. Indeed we might."

    She swept out, with a smile, and a hand on her hip. Her hair gleamed in the light.

    The Commdor waited, and then said to the closed door, with malignance and hate, "And when I
    am master of what you call the hinterland, I may be sufficiently respectable to do without your
    father's arrogance and his daughter's tongue. Completely - without!"


    17 .

    The senior lieutenant of the Dark Nebula stared in horror at the visiplate.

    "Great Galloping Galaxies!" It should have been a howl, but it was a whisper instead, "What's
    that?"

    It was a ship, but a whale to the Dark Nebula's minnow; and on its side was the
    Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire. Every alarm on the ship yammered hysterically.

    The orders went out, and the Dark Nebula prepared to run if it could, and fight if it must, -while
    down in the hyperwave room, a message stormed its way through hyperspace to the
    Foundation.

    Over and over again! Partly a plea for help, but mainly a warning of danger.


    18 .

    Flober Mallow shuffled his feet wearily as he leafed through the reports. Two years of the
    mayoralty had made him a bit more housebroken, a bit softer, a bit more patient, -but it had not
    made him learn to like government reports and the mind-breaking officialese in which they were
    written.

    "Flow many ships did they get?" asked Jael.

    "Four trapped on the ground. Two unreported. All others accounted for and safe." Mallow
    grunted, "We should have done better, but it's just a scratch."

    There was no answer and Mallow looked up, "Does anything worry you?"

    "I wish Sutt would get here," was the almost irrelevant answer.

    "Ah, yes, and now we'll hear another lecture on the home front."



    "No, we won't," snapped Jael, "but you're stubborn, Mallow. You may have worked out the
    foreign situation to the last detail but you've never given a care about what goes on here on the
    home planet."

    "Well, that's your job, isn't it? What did I make you Minister of Education and Propaganda for?"

    "Obviously to send me to an early and miserable grave, for all the co-operation you give me.

    For the last year, I've been deafening you with the rising danger of Sutt and his Religionists.
    What good will your plans be, if Sutt forces a special election and has you thrown out?"

    "None, I admit."

    "And your speech last night just about handed the election to Sutt with a smile and a pat. Was
    there any necessity for being so frank?"

    "Isn't there such a thing as stealing Sutt's thunder?"

    "No," said Jael, violently, "not the way you did it. You claim to have foreseen everything, and
    don't explain why you traded with Korell to their exclusive benefit for three years. Your only plan
    of battle is to retire without a battle. You abandon all trade with the sectors of space near Korell.
    You openly proclaim a stalemate. You promise no offensive, even in the future. Galaxy, Mallow,
    what am I supposed to do with such a mess?"

    "It lacks glamor?"

    "It lacks mob emotion-appeal."

    "Same thing."

    "Mallow, wake up. You have two alternatives. Either you present the people with a dynamic
    foreign policy, whatever your private plans are, or you make some sort of compromise with
    Sutt."

    Mallow said, "All right, if I've failed the first, let's try the second. Sutt's just arrived."

    Sutt and Mallow had not met personally since the day of the trial, two years back. Neither
    detected any change in the other, except for that subtle atmosphere about each which made it
    quite evident that the roles of ruler and defier had changed.

    Sutt took his seat without shaking hands.

    Mallow offered a cigar and said, "Mind if Jael stays? He wants a compromise earnestly. He can
    act as mediator if tempers rise."

    Sutt shrugged, "A compromise will be well for you. Upon another occasion I once asked you to
    state your terms. I presume the positions are reversed now."

    "You presume correctly."

    "Then there are my terms. You must abandon your blundering policy of economic bribery and
    trade in gadgetry, and return to the tested foreign policy of our fathers."



    "You mean conquest by missionary."

    "Exactly."

    "No compromise short of that?"

    "None."

    "Um-m-m." Mallow lit up very slowly and inhaled the tip of his cigar into a bright glow. "In
    Hardin's time, when conquest by missionary was new and radical, men like yourself opposed it.
    Now it is tried, tested, hallowed, -everything a Jorane Sutt would find well. But, tell me, how
    would you get us out of our present mess?"

    "Your present mess. I had nothing to do with it."

    "Consider the question suitably modified."

    "A strong offensive is indicated. The stalemate you seem to be satisfied with is fatal. It would be
    a confession of weakness to all the worlds of the Periphery, where the appearance of strength
    is all-important, and there's not one vulture among them that wouldn't join the assault for its
    share of the corpse. You ought to understand that. You're from Smyrno, aren't you?"

    Mallow passed over the significance of the remark. He said, "And if you beat Korell, what of the
    Empire? That is the real enemy."

    Sutt's narrow smile tugged at the comers of his mouth, "Oh, no, your records of your visit to
    Siwenna were complete. The viceroy of the Normannic Sector is interested in creating
    dissension in the Periphery for his own benefit, but only as a side issue. He isn't going to stake
    everything on an expedition to the Galaxy's rim when he has fifty hostile neighbors and an
    emperor to rebel against. I paraphrase your own words."

    "Oh, yes he might, Sutt, if he thinks we're strong enough to be dangerous. And he might think
    so, if we destroy Korell by the main force of frontal attack. We'd have to be considerably more
    subtle."

    "As for instance-"

    Mallow leaned back, "Sutt, I'll give you your chance. I don't need you, but I can use you. So I'll
    tell you what it's all about, and then you can either join me and receive a place in a coalition
    cabinet, or you can play the martyr and rot in jail."

    "Once before you tried that last trick."

    "Not very hard, Sutt. The right time has only just come. Now listen." Mallow's eyes narrowed.

    "When I first landed on Korell," he began, A bribed the Commdor with the trinkets and gadgets
    that form the trader's usual stock. At the start, that, was meant only to get us entrance into a
    steel foundry. I had no plan further than that, but in that I succeeded. I got what I wanted. But it
    was only after my visit to the Empire that I first realized exactly what a weapon I could build that
    trade into.



    "This is a Seldon crisis we're facing, Sutt, and Seldon crises are not solved by individuals but by
    historic forces. Hari Seldon, when he planned our course of future history, did not count on
    brilliant heroics but on the broad sweeps of economics and sociology. So the solutions to the
    various crises must be achieved by the forces that become available to us at the time.

    "In this case, -trade!"

    Sutt raised his eyebrows skeptically and took advantage of the pause, "I hope I am not of
    subnormal intelligence, but the fact is that your vague lecture isn't very illuminating."

    "It will become so," said Mallow. "Consider that until now the power of trade has been
    underestimated. It has been thought that it took a priesthood under our control to make it a
    powerful weapon. That is not so, and this is my contribution to the Galactic situation. Trade
    without priests! Trade alone! It is strong enough. Let us become very simple and specific. Korell
    is now at war with us. Consequently our trade with her has stopped. But, -notice that I am
    making this as simple as a problem in addition, -in the past three years she has based her
    economy more and more upon the nuclear techniques which we have introduced and which
    only we can continue to supply. Now what do you suppose will happen once the tiny nuclear
    generators begin failing, and one gadget after another goes out of commission?

    "The small household appliances go first. After a half a year of this stalemate that you abhor, a
    woman's nuclear knife won't work any more. Her stove begins failing. Her washer doesn't do a
    good job. The temperature-humidity control in her house dies on a hot summer day. What
    happens?"

    He paused for an answer, and Sutt said calmly, "Nothing. People endure a good deal in war."

    "Very true. They do. They'll send their sons out in unlimited numbers to die horribly on broken
    spaceships. They'll bear up under enemy bombardment, if it means they have to live on stale
    bread and foul water in caves half a mile deep. But it's very hard to bear up under little things
    when the patriotic uplift of imminent danger is not present. It's going to, be a stalemate. There
    will be no casualties, no bombardments, no battles.

    "There will just be a knife that won't cut, and a stove that won't cook, and a house that freezes
    in the winter. It will be annoying, and people will grumble."

    Sutt said slowly, wonderingly, "Is that what you're setting your hopes on, man? What do you
    expect? A housewives' rebellion? A Jacquerie? A sudden uprising of butchers and grocers with
    their cleavers and bread-knives shouting 'Give us back our Automatic Super-Kleeno Nuclear
    Washing Machines.'"

    "No, sir," said Mallow, impatiently, "I do not. I expect, however, a general background of
    grumbling and dissatisfaction which will be seized on by more important figures later on."

    "And what more important figures are these?"

    "The manufacturers, the factory owners, the industrialists of Korell. When two years of the
    stalemate have gone, the machines in the factories will, one by one, begin to fail. Those
    industries which we have changed from first to last with our new nuclear gadgets will find
    themselves very suddenly ruined. The heavy industries will find themselves, en masse and at a



    stroke, the owners of nothing but scrap machinery that won't work."

    "The factories ran well enough before you came there, Mallow."

    "Yes, Sutt, so they did - at about one-twentieth the profits, even if you leave out of
    consideration the cost of reconversion to the original pre-nuclear state. With the industrialist
    and financier and the average man all against him, how long will the Commdor hold out?"

    "As long as he pleases, as soon as it occurs to him to get new nuclear generators from the
    Empire."

    And Mallow laughed joyously, "You've missed, Sutt, missed as badly as the Commdor himself.
    You've missed everything, and understood nothing. Look, man, the Empire can replace
    nothing. The Empire has always been a realm of colossal resources. They've calculated
    everything in planets, in stellar systems, in whole sectors of the Galaxy. Their generators are
    gigantic because they thought in gigantic fashion.

    "But we, -we, our little Foundation, our single world almost without metallic resources, -have
    had to work with brute economy. Our generators have had to be the size of our thumb, because
    it was all the metal we could afford. We had to develop new techniques and new methods,
    -techniques and methods the Empire can't follow because they have degenerated past the
    stage where they can make any really vital scientific advance.

    "With all their nuclear shields, large enough to protect a ship, a city, an entire world; they could
    never build one to protect a single man. To supply light and heat to a city, they have motors six
    stories high, -I saw them - where ours could fit into this room. And when I told one of their
    nuclear specialists that a lead container the size of a walnut contained a nuclear generator, he
    almost choked with indignation on the spot.

    "Why, they don't even understand their own colossi any longer. The machines work from
    generation to generation automatically, and the caretakers are a hereditary caste who would be
    helpless if a single D-tube in all that vast structure burnt out.

    "The whole war is a battle between those two systems, between the Empire and the
    Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of a world, they bribe with immense
    ships that can make war, but lack all economic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with
    little things, useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits.

    "A king, or a Commdor, will take the ships and even make war. Arbitrary rulers throughout
    history have bartered their subjects' welfare for what they consider honor, and glory, and
    conquest. But it's still the little things in life that count - and Asper Argo won't stand up against
    the economic depression that will sweep all Korell in two or three years."

    Sutt was at the window, his back to Mallow and Jael. It was early evening now, and the few
    stars that struggled feebly here at the very rim of the Galaxy sparked against the background of
    the misty, wispy Lens that included the remnants of that Empire, still vast, that fought against
    them.


    Sutt said, "No. You are not the man.



    You don't believe me?


    "I mean I don't trust you. You're smooth-tongued. You befooled me properly when I thought I
    had you under proper care on your first trip to Korell. When I thought I had you cornered at the
    trial, you wormed your way out of it and into the mayor's chair by demagoguery. There is
    nothing straight about you; no motive that hasn't another behind it; no statement that hasn't
    three meanings.

    "Suppose you were a traitor. Suppose your visit to the Empire had brought you a subsidy and a
    promise of power. Your actions would be precisely what they are now. You would bring about a
    war after having strengthened the enemy. You would force the Foundation into inactivity. And
    you would advance a plausible explanation of everything, one so plausible it would convince
    everyone."

    "You mean there'll be no compromise?" asked Mallow, gently.

    "I mean you must get out, by free will or force."

    "I warned you of the only alternative to co-operation."

    Jorane Sutt's face congested with blood in a sudden access of emotion. "And I warn you,

    Hober Mallow of Smyrno, that if you arrest me, there will be no quarter. My men will stop
    nowhere in spreading the truth about you, and the common people of the Foundation will unite
    against their foreign ruler. They have a consciousness of destiny that a Smyrnian can never
    understand - and that consciousness will destroy you."

    Flober Mallow said quietly to the two guards who had entered, "Take him away. Fle's under
    arrest."

    Sutt said, "Your last chance."

    Mallow stubbed out his cigar and never looked up.

    And five minutes later, Jael stirred and said, wearily, "Well, now that you've made a martyr for
    the cause, what next?"

    Mallow stopped playing with the ash tray and looked up, "That's not the Sutt I used to know.
    Fle's a blood-blind bull. Galaxy, he hates me."

    "All the more dangerous then."

    "More dangerous? Nonsense! Fle's lost all power of judgement."

    Jael said grimly, "You're overconfident, Mallow. You're ignoring the possibility of a popular
    rebellion."

    Mallow looked up, grim in his turn, "Once and for all, Jael, there is no possibility of a popular
    rebellion."

    "You're sure of yourself!"

    "I'm sure of the Seldon crisis and the historical validity of their solutions, externally and



    internally. There are some things I didn't tell Suit right now. He tried to control the Foundation
    itself by religious forces as he controlled the outer worlds, and he failed, -which is the surest
    sign that in the Seldon scheme, religion is played out.

    "Economic control worked differently. And to paraphrase that famous Salvor Hardin quotation of
    yours, it's a poor nuclear blaster that won't point both ways. If Korell prospered with our trade,
    so did we. If Korellian factories fail without our trade; and if the prosperity of the outer worlds
    vanishes with commercial isolation; so will our factories fail and our prosperity vanish.

    "And there isn't a factory, not a trading center, not a shipping line that isn't under my control;
    that I couldn't squeeze to nothing if Sutt attempts revolutionary propaganda. Where his
    propaganda succeeds, or even looks as though it might succeed, I will make certain that
    prosperity dies. Where it fails, prosperity will continue, because my factories will remain fully
    staffed.

    "So by the same reasoning which makes me sure that the Korellians will revolt in favor of
    prosperity, I am sure we will not revolt against it. The game will be played out to its end."

    "So then," said Jael, "you're establishing a plutocracy. You're making us a land of traders and
    merchant princes. Then what of the future?"

    Mallow lifted his gloomy face, and exclaimed fiercely, "What business of mine is the future? No
    doubt Seldon has foreseen it and prepared against it. There will be other crises in the time to
    come when money power has become as dead a force as religion is now. Let my successors
    solve those new problems, as I have solved the one of today."

    KORELL-.. .And so after three years of a war which was certainly the most unfought war on
    record, the Republic of Korell surrendered unconditionally, and Hober Mallow took his place
    next to Hari Seldon and Salvor Hardin in the hearts of the people of the Foundation.

    ABOUT THE AUTHOR

    Isaac Asimov was born in the Soviet Union to his great surprise. He moved quickly to correct
    the situation. When his parents emigrated to the United States, Isaac (three years old at the
    time) stowed away in their baggage. He has been an American citizen since the age of eight.

    Brought up in Brooklyn, and educated in its public schools, he eventually found his way to
    Columbia University and, over the protests of the school administration, managed to annex a
    series of degrees in chemistry, up to and including a Ph.D. He then infiltrated Boston University
    and climbed the academic ladder, ignoring all cries of outrage, until he found himself Professor
    of Biochemistry.

    Meanwhile, at the age of nine, he found the love of his life (in the inanimate sense) when he
    discovered his first science-fiction magazine. By the time he was eleven, he began to write



    stories, and at eighteen, he actually worked up the nerve to submit one. It was rejected. After
    four long months of tribulation and suffering, he sold his first story and, thereafter, he never
    looked back.

    In 1941 , when he was twenty-one years old, he wrote the classic short story "Nightfall" and his
    future was assured. Shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories, and shortly after
    that he had begun his Foundation series.


    What was left except quantity? At the present time, he has published over 260 books,
    distributed through every major division of the Dewey system of library classification, and
    shows no signs of slowing up. He remains as youthful, as lively, and as lovable as ever, and
    grows more handsome with each year. You can be sure that this is so since he has written this
    little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious.

    He is married to Janet Jeppson, psychiatrist and writer, has two children by a previous
    marriage, and lives in New York City.

    The Galactic Empire Was Falling.

    It was a colossal Empire, stretching across millions of worlds from arm-end to arm-end of the
    mighty multi-spiral that was the Milky Way. Its fall was colossal, too - and a long one, for it had
    a long way to go.

    It had been falling for centuries before one man became really aware of that fall. That man was
    Hari Seldon, the man who represented the one spark of creative effort left among the gathering
    decay. He developed and brought to its highest pitch the science of psychohistory.

    Psychohistory dealt not with man, but with man-masses. It was the science of mobs; mobs in
    their billions. It could forecast reactions to stimuli with something of the accuracy that a lesser
    science could bring to the forecast of a rebound of a billiard ball. The reaction of one man could
    be forecast by no known mathematics; the reaction of a billion is something else again.

    Hari Seldon plotted the social and economic trends of the time, sighted along the curves and
    foresaw the continuing and accelerating fall of civilization and the gap of thirty thousand years
    that must elapse before a struggling new Empire could emerge from the ruins.

    It was too late to stop that fall, but not too late to narrow the gap of barbarism. Seldon
    established two Foundations at "opposite ends of the Galaxy" and their location was so
    designed that in one short millennium events would knit and mesh so as to force out of them a
    stronger, more permanent, more benevolent Second Empire.

    Foundation (Gnome Press, 1951) has told the story of one of those Foundations during the first
    two centuries of life.

    It began as a settlement of physical scientists on Terminus, a planet at the extreme end of one
    of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Separated from the turmoil of the Empire, they worked as
    compilers of a universal compendium of knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica, unaware of
    the deeper role planned for them by the already-dead Seldon,

    As the Empire rotted, the outer regions fell into the hands of independent "kings." The
    Foundation was threatened by them. However, by playing one petty ruler against another,
    under the leadership of their first mayor, Salvor Hardin, they maintained a precarious
    independence. As sole possessors, of nuclear power among worlds which were losing their
    sciences and falling back on coal and oil, they even established an ascendancy. The
    Foundation became the "religious" center of the neighboring kingdoms.


    Slowly, the Foundation developed a trading economy as the Encyclopedia receded into the
    background. Their Traders, dealing in nuclear gadgets which not even the Empire in its heyday
    could have duplicated for compactness, penetrated hundreds of light-years through the
    Periphery.

    Under Hober Mallow, the first of the Foundation's Merchant Princes, they developed the
    techniques of economic warfare to the point of defeating the Republic of Korell, even though
    that world was receiving support from one of the outer provinces of what was left of the Empire.

    At the end of two hundred years, the Foundation was the most powerful state in the Galaxy,
    except for the remains of the Empire, which, concentrated in the inner third of the Milky Way,
    still controlled three quarters of the population and wealth of the Universe.

    It seemed inevitable that the next danger the Foundation would have to face was the final lash
    of the dying Empire.

    The way must he cleared for the battle of Foundation and Empire.


    PART I

    THE GENERAL


    1. SEARCH FOR MAGICIANS

    BEL RIOSE .... In his relatively short career, Riose earned the title of "The Last of the Imperials''
    and earned It well. A study of his campaigns reveals him to be the equal of Peurifoy in strategic
    ability and his superior perhaps in his ability to handle men. That he was born in the days of the
    decline of Empire made it all but impossible for him to equal Peurifoy's record as a conqueror.
    Yet he had his chance when, the first of the Empire's generals to do so, he faced the
    Foundation squarely....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA*

    *AII quotations from the Encyclopedia Galactica here reproduced are taken from the 1 1 6th
    Edition published in 1020 F.E. by the Encyclopedia Galactica Publishing Co., Terminus, with
    permission of the publishers.

    Bel Riose traveled without escort, which is not what court etiquette prescribes for the head of a
    fleet stationed in a yet-sullen stellar system on the Marches of the Galactic Empire.

    But Bel Riose was young and energetic - energetic enough to be sent as near the end of the
    universe as possible by an unemotional and calculating court - and curious besides. Strange
    and improbable tales fancifully-repeated by hundreds and murkily-known to thousands intrigued





    the last faculty; the possibility of a military venture engaged the other two. The combination was
    overpowering.

    He was out of the dowdy ground-car he had appropriated and at the door of the fading mansion
    that was his destination. He waited. The photonic eye that spanned the doorway was alive, but
    when the door opened it was by hand.

    Bel Riose smiled at the old man. "I am Riose-"

    "I recognize you." The old man remained stiffly and unsurprised in his place. "Your business?"

    Riose withdrew a step in a gesture of submission. "One of peace. If you are Ducem Barr, I ask
    the favor of conversation."

    Ducem Barr stepped aside and in the interior of the house the walls glowed into life, The
    general entered into daylight.

    He touched the wall of the study, then stared at his fingertips. "You have this on Siwenna?"

    Barr smiled thinly. "Not elsewhere, I believe. I keep this in repair myself as well as I can. I must
    apologize for your wait at the door. The automatic device registers the presence of a visitor but
    will no longer open the door."

    "Your repairs fall short?" The general's voice was faintly mocking.

    "Parts are no longer available. If you will sit, sir. You drink tea?"

    "On Siwenna? My good sir, it is socially impossible not to drink it here."

    The old patrician retreated noiselessly with a slow bow that was part of the ceremonious legacy
    left by the aristocracy of the last century's better days.

    Riose looked after his host's departing figure, and his studied urbanity grew a bit uncertain at
    the edges. His education had been purely military; his experience likewise. He had, as the
    cliche, has it, faced death many times; but always death of a very familiar and tangible nature,
    Consequently, there is no inconsistency in the fact that the idolized lion of the Twentieth Fleet
    felt chilled in the suddenly musty atmosphere of an ancient room.

    The general recognized the small black-ivroid boxes that lined the shelves to be books. Their
    titles were unfamiliar. He guessed that the large structure at one end of the room was the
    receiver that transmuted the books into sight-and-sound on demand. He had never seen one in
    operation; but he had heard of them.

    Once he had been told that long before, during the golden ages when the Empire had been
    co-extensive with the entire Galaxy, nine houses out of every ten had such receivers - and
    such rows of books.

    But there were borders to watch now; books were for old men. And half the stories told about
    the old days were mythical anyway. More than half.

    The tea arrived, and Riose seated himself. Ducem Barr lifted his cup. "To your honor."



    "Thank you. To yours."

    Ducem Barr said deliberately, "You are said to be young. Thirty-five?"

    "Near enough. Thirty-four."

    "In that case," said Barr, with soft emphasis, "I could not begin better than by informing you
    regretfully that I am not in the possession of love charms, potions, or philtres. Nor am I in the
    least capable of influencing the favors of any young lady as may appeal to you."

    "I have no need of artificial aids in that respect, sir." The complacency undeniably present in the
    general's voice was stirred with amusement. "Do you receive many requests for such
    commodities?"

    "Enough. Unfortunately, an uninformed public tends to confuse scholarship with magicianry,
    and love life seems to be that factor which requires the largest quantity of magical tinkering."

    "And so would seem most natural. But I differ. I connect scholarship with nothing but the means
    of answering difficult questions."

    The Siwennian considered somberly, "You may be as wrong as they!"

    "That may turn out or not." The young general set down his cup in its flaring sheath and it
    refilled. He dropped the offered flavor-capsule into it with a small splash. "Tell me then,
    patrician, who are the magicians? The real ones."

    Barr seemed startled at a title long-unused. He said, "There are no magicians."

    "But people speak of them. Siwenna crawls with the tales of them. There are cults being built
    about them. There is some strange connection between it and those groups among your
    countrymen who dream and drivel of ancient days and what they call liberty and autonomy.
    Eventually the matter might become a danger to the State."

    The old man shook his head. "Why ask me? Do you smell rebellion, with myself at the head?"

    Riose shrugged, "Never. Never. Oh, it is not a thought completely ridiculous. Your father was
    an exile in his day; you yourself a patriot and a chauvinist in yours. It is indelicate in me as a
    guest to mention it, but my business here requires it. And yet a conspiracy now? I doubt it.
    Siwenna has had the spirit beat out of it these three generations."

    The old man replied with difficulty, "I shall be as indelicate a host as you a guest. I shall remind
    you that once a viceroy thought as you did of the spiritless Siwennians. By the orders of that
    viceroy my father became a fugitive pauper, my brothers martyrs, and my sister a suicide. Yet
    that viceroy died a death sufficiently horrible at the hands of these same slavish Siwennians."

    "Ah, yes, and there you touch nearly on something I could wish to say. For three years the
    mysterious death of that viceroy has been no mystery to me. There was a young soldier of his
    personal guard whose actions were of interest. You were that soldier, but there is no need of
    details, I think."


    Barr was quiet. "None. What do you propose?



    "That you answer my questions."

    "Not under threats. I am old enough for life not to mean particularly overmuch."

    "My good sir, these are hard times," said Riose, with meaning, "and you have children and
    friends. You have a country for which you have mouthed phrases of love and folly in the past.
    Come, if I should decide to use force, my aim would not be so poor as to strike you."

    Barr said coldly, "What do you want?"

    Riose held the empty cup as he spoke. "Patrician, listen to me. These are days when the most
    successful soldiers are those whose function is to lead the dress parades that wind through the
    imperial palace grounds on feast days and to escort the sparkling pleasure ships that carry His
    Imperial Splendor to the summer planets. I ... I am a failure. I am a failure at thirty-four, and I
    shall stay a failure. Because, you see, I like to fight.

    "That's why they sent me here. I'm too troublesome at court. I don't fit in with the etiquette. I
    offend the dandies and the lord admirals, but I'm too good a leader of ships and men to be
    disposed of shortly be being marooned in space. So Siwenna is the substitute. It's a frontier
    world; a rebellious and a barren province. It is far away, far enough away to satisfy all.

    "And so I moulder. There are no rebellions to stamp down, and the border viceroys do not
    revolt lately, at least, not since His Imperial Majesty's late father of glorious memory made an
    example of Mountel of Paramay."

    "A strong Emperor," muttered Barr.

    "Yes, and we need more of them. He is my master; remember that. These are his interests I
    guard."

    Barr shrugged unconcernedly. "How does all this relate to the subject?"

    "I'll show you in two words. The magicians I've mentioned come from beyond-out there beyond
    the frontier guards, where the stars are scattered thinly-"

    "'Where the stars are scattered thinly,'" quoted Barr, '"And the cold of space seeps in."'

    "Is that poetry?" Riose frowned. Verse seemed frivolous at the moment. "In any case, they're
    from the Periphery - from the only quarter where I am free to fight for the glory of the Emperor."

    "And thus serve His Imperial Majesty's interests and satisfy your own love of a good fight."

    "Exactly. But I must know what I fight; and there you can help."

    "How do you know?"

    Riose nibbled casually at a cakelet. "Because for three years I have traced every rumor, every
    myth, every breath concerning the magicians - and of all the library of information I have
    gathered, only two isolated facts are unanimously agreed upon, and are hence certainly true.
    The first is that the magicians come from the edge of the Galaxy opposite Siwenna; the second
    is that your father once met a magician, alive and actual, and spoke with him."



    The aged Siwennian stared unblinkingly, and Riose continued, "You had better tell me what
    you know-"

    Barr said thoughtfully, "It would be interesting to tell you certain things. It would be a
    psychohistoric experiment of my own."

    "What kind of experiment?"

    "Psychohistoric." The old man had an unpleasant edge to his smile. Then, crisply, "You'd better
    have more tea. I'm going to make a bit of a speech."

    He leaned far back into the soft cushions of his chair. The wall-lights had softened to a
    pink-ivory glow, which mellowed even the soldier's hard profile.

    Ducem Barr began, "My own knowledge is the result of two accidents; the accidents of being
    born the son of my father, and of being born the native of my country. It begins over forty years
    ago, shortly after the great Massacre, when my father was a fugitive in the forests of the South,
    while I was a gunner in the viceroy's personal fleet. This same viceroy, by the way, who had
    ordered the Massacre, and who died such a cruel death thereafter."

    Barr smiled grimly, and continued, "My father was a Patrician of the Empire and a Senator of
    Siwenna. His name was Onum Barr."

    Riose interrupted impatiently, "I know the circumstances of his exile very well. You needn't
    elaborate upon it."

    The Siwennian ignored him and proceeded without deflection. "During his exile a wanderer
    came upon him; a merchant from the edge of the Galaxy; a young man who spoke a strange
    accent, knew nothing of recent Imperial history, and who was protected by an individual
    force-shield."

    "An individual force-shield?" Riose glared. "You speak extravagance. What generator could be
    powerful enough to condense a shield to the size of a single man? By the Great Galaxy, did he
    carry five thousand myria-tons of nuclear power-source about with him on a little wheeled
    gocart?"

    Barr said quietly, "This is the magician of whom you hear whispers, stories and myths. The
    name 'magician' is not lightly earned. He carried no generator large enough to be seen, but not
    the heaviest weapon you can carry in your hand would have as much as creased the shield he
    bore."

    "Is this all the story there is? Are the magicians born of maunderings of an old man broken by
    suffering and exile?"

    "The story of the magicians antedated even my father, sir. And the proof is more concrete. After
    leaving my father, this merchant that men call a magician visited a Tech-man at the city to
    which my father had guided him, and there he left a shield-generator of the type he wore. That
    generator was retrieved by my father after his return from exile upon the execution of the
    bloody viceroy. It took a long time to find-



    "The generator hangs on the wall behind you, sir. It does not work. It never worked but for the
    first two days; but if you'll look at it, you will see that no one in the Empire ever designed it."

    Bel Riose reached for the belt of linked metal that clung to the curved wall. It came away with a
    little sucking noise as the tiny adhesion-field broke at the touch of his hand. The ellipsoid at the
    apex of the belt held his attention. It was the size of a walnut.

    "This-" he said.

    "Was the generator," nodded Barr. "But it was the generator. The secret of its workings are
    beyond discovery now. Sub-electronic investigations have shown it to be fused into a single
    lump of metal and not all the most careful study of the diffraction patterns have sufficed to
    distinguish the discrete parts that had existed before fusion."

    "Then your 'proof still lingers on the frothy border of words backed by no concrete evidence."

    Barr shrugged. "You have demanded my knowledge of me and threatened its extortion by
    force. If you choose to meet it with skepticism, what is that to me? Do you want me to stop?"

    "Go on!" said the general, harshly.

    "I continued my father's researches after he died, and then the second accident I mentioned
    came to help me, for Siwenna was well known to Hari Seldon."

    "And who is Hari Seldon?"

    "Hari Seldon was a scientist of the reign of the Emperor, Daluben IV. He was a psychohistorian;
    the last and greatest of them all. He once visited Siwenna, when Siwenna was a great
    commercial center, rich in the arts and sciences."

    "Hmph," muttered Riose, sourly, "where is the stagnant planet that does not claim to have been
    a land of overflowing wealth in older days?"

    "The days I speak of are the days of two centuries ago, when the Emperor yet ruled to the
    uttermost star; when Siwenna was a world of the interior and not a semi-barbarian border
    province. In those days, Hari Seldon foresaw the decline of Imperial power and the eventual
    barbarization of the entire Galaxy."

    Riose laughed suddenly. "He foresaw that? Then he foresaw wrong, my good scientist. I
    suppose you call yourself that. Why, the Empire is more powerful now than it has been in a
    millennium. Your old eyes are blinded by the cold bleakness of the border. Come to the inner
    worlds some day; come to the warmth and the wealth of the center."

    The old man shook his head somberly. "Circulation ceases first at the outer edges. It will take a
    while yet for the decay to reach the heart. That is, the apparent, obvious-to-all decay, as distinct
    from the inner decay that is an old story of some fifteen centuries."

    "And so this Hari Seldon foresaw a Galaxy of uniform barbarism," said Riose, good-humoredly.
    "And what then, eh?"


    So he established two foundations at the extreme opposing ends of the Galaxy - Foundations



    of the best, and the youngest, and the strongest, there to breed, grow, and develop. The worlds
    on which they were placed were chosen carefully; as were the times and the surroundings. All
    was arranged in such a way that the future as foreseen by the unalterable mathematics of
    psychohistory would involve their early isolation from the main body of Imperial civilization and
    their gradual growth into the germs of the Second Galactic Empire - cutting an inevitable
    barbarian interregnum from thirty thousand years to scarcely a single thousand."

    "And where did you find out all this? You seem to know it in detail."

    "I don't and never did," said the patrician with composure. "It is the painful result of the piecing
    together of certain evidence discovered by my father and a little more found by myself. The
    basis is flimsy and the superstructure has been romanticized into existence to fill the huge
    gaps. But I am convinced that it is essentially true."

    "You are easily convinced."

    "Am I? It has taken forty years of research."

    "Hmph. Forty years! I could settle the question in forty days. In fact, I believe I ought to. It would
    be - different."

    "And how would you do that?"

    "In the obvious way. I could become an explorer. I could find this Foundation you speak of and
    observe with my eyes. You say there are two?"

    "The records speak of two. Supporting evidence has been found only for one, which is
    understandable, for the other is at the extreme end of the long axis of the Galaxy."

    "Well, we'll visit the near one." The general was on his feet, adjusting his belt.

    "You know where to go?" asked Barr.

    "In a way. In the records of the last viceroy but one, he whom you murdered so effectively,
    there are suspicious tales of outer barbarians. In fact, one of his daughters was given in
    marriage to a barbarian prince. I'll find my way."

    Fie held out a hand. "I thank you for your hospitality."

    Ducem Barr touched the hand with his fingers and bowed formally. "Your visit was a great
    honor."

    "As for the information you gave me," continued Bel Riose, "I'll know how to thank you for that
    when I return."


    Ducem Barr followed his guest submissively to the outer door and said quietly to the
    disappearing ground-car, "And if you return."



    2. THE MAGICIANS

    FOUNDATION ... With forty years of expansion behind them, the Foundation faced the menace
    of Riose. The epic days of Hardin and Mallow had gone and with them were gone a certain
    hard daring and resolution....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    There were four men in the room, and the room was set apart where none could approach. The
    four men looked at each other quickly, then lengthily at the table that separated them. There
    were four bottles on the table and as many full glasses, but no one had touched them.

    And then the man nearest the door stretched out an arm and drummed a slow, padding rhythm
    on the table.

    He said, "Are you going to sit and wonder forever? Does it matter who speaks first?"

    "Speak you first, then," said the big man directly opposite. "You're the one who should be the
    most worried."

    Sennett Forell chuckled with noiseless nonhumor. "Because you think I'm the richest. Well - Or
    is it that you expect me to continue as I have started. I don't suppose you forget that it was my
    own Trade Fleet that captured this scout ship of theirs."

    "You had the largest fleet," said a third, "and the best pilots; which is another way of saying you
    are the richest. It was a fearful risk; and would have been greater for one of us."

    Sennett Forell chuckled again. "There is a certain facility in risk-taking that I inherit from my
    father. After all, the essential point in running a risk is that the returns justify it. As to which,
    witness the fact that the enemy ship was isolated and captured without loss to ourselves or
    warning to the others."

    That Forell was a distant collateral relative of the late great Hober Mallow was recognized
    openly throughout the Foundation. That he was Mallow's illegitimate son was accepted quietly
    to just as wide an extent.

    The fourth man blinked his little eyes stealthily. Words crept out from between thin lips. "It is
    nothing to sleep over in fat triumph, this grasping of little ships. Most likely, it will but anger that
    young man further."

    "You think he needs motives?" questioned Forell, scornfully.

    "I do, and this might, or will, save him the vexation of having to manufacture one." The fourth
    man spoke slowly, "Hober Mallow worked otherwise. And Salvor Hardin. They let others take
    the uncertain paths of force, while they maneuvered surely and quietly."

    Forell shrugged. "This ship has proved its value. Motives are cheap and we have sold this one
    at a profit." There was the satisfaction of the born Trader in that. He continued, "The young
    man is of the old Empire."

    "We knew that," said the second man, the big one, with rumbling discontent.



    "We suspected that," corrected Forell, softly. "If a man comes with ships and wealth, with
    overtures of friendliness, and with offers of trade, it is only sensible to refrain from antagonizing
    him, until we are certain that the profitable mask is not a face after all. But now-"

    There was a faint whining edge to the third man's voice as he spoke. "We might have been
    even more careful. We might have found out first. We might have found out before allowing him
    to leave. It would have been the truest wisdom."

    "That has been discussed and disposed of," said Forell. Fie waved the subject aside with a
    flatly final gesture.

    "The government is soft," complained the third man. "The mayor is an idiot."

    The fourth man looked at the other three in turn and removed the stub of a cigar from his
    mouth. Fie dropped it casually into the slot at his right where it disappeared with a silent flash of
    disruption.

    Fie said sarcastically, "I trust the gentleman who last spoke is speaking through habit only. We
    can afford to remember here that we are the government."

    There was a murmur of agreement.

    The fourth man's little eyes were on the table. "Then let us leave government policy alone. This
    young man ... this stranger might have been a possible customer. There have been cases. All
    three of you tried to butter him into an advance contract. We have an agreement - a
    gentleman's agreement - against it, but you tried."

    "So did you," growled the second man.

    I know it," said the fourth, calmly.

    "Then let's forget what we should have done earlier," interrupted Forell impatiently, "and
    continue with what we should do now. In any case, what if we had imprisoned him, or killed
    him, what then? We are not certain of his intentions even yet, and at the worst, we could not
    destroy an Empire by snipping short one man's life. There might be navies upon navies waiting
    just the other side of his nonreturn."

    "Exactly," approved the fourth man. "Now what did you get out of your captured ship? I'm too
    old for all this talking."

    "It can be told in a few enough words," said Forell, grimly. "Fle's an Imperial general or
    whatever rank corresponds to that over there. Fle's a young man who has proved his military
    brilliance - so I am told - and who is the idol of his men. Quite a romantic career. The stories
    they tell of him are no doubt half lies, but even so it makes him out to be a type of wonder
    man."

    "Who are the 'they'?" demanded the second man.

    "The crew of the captured ship. Look, I have all their statements recorded on micro-film, which I
    have in a secure place. Later on, if you wish, you can see them. You can talk to the men
    yourselves, if you think it necessary. I've told you the essentials."



    "How did you get it out of them? How do you know they're telling the truth?"

    Forell frowned. "I wasn't gentle, good sir. I knocked them about, drugged them crazy, and used
    the Probe unmercifully. They talked. You can believe them."

    "In the old days," said the third man, with sudden irrelevance, "they would have used pure
    psychology. Painless, you know, but very sure. No chance of deceit."

    "Well, there is a good deal they had in the old days," said Forell, dryly. "These are the new
    days."

    "But," said the fourth man, "what did he want here, this general, this romantic wonder-man?"
    There was a dogged, weary persistence about him.

    Forell glanced at him sharply. "You think he confides the details of state policy to his crew?
    They didn't know. There was nothing to get out of them in that respect, and I tried, Galaxy
    knows."

    "Which leaves us-"

    "To draw our own conclusions, obviously." Forell's fingers were tapping quietly again. "The
    young man is a military leader of the Empire, yet he played the pretense of being a minor
    princeling of some scattered stars in an odd comer of the Periphery. That alone would assure
    us that his real motives are such as it would not benefit him to have us know. Combine the
    nature of his profession with the fact that the Empire has already subsidized one attack upon us
    in my father's time, and the possibilities become ominous. That first attack failed. I doubt that
    the Empire owes us love for that."

    "There is nothing in your findings," questioned the fourth man guardedly, "that makes for
    certainty? You are withholding nothing?"

    Forell answered levelly, "I can't withhold anything. From here on there can be no question of
    business rivalry. Unity is forced upon us."

    "Patriotism?" There was a sneer in the third man's thin voice.

    "Patriotism be damned," said Forell quietly. "Do you think I give two puffs of nuclear emanation
    for the future Second Empire? Do you think I'd risk a single Trade mission to smooth its path?
    But - do you suppose Imperial conquest will help my business or yours? If the Empire wins,
    there will be a sufficient number of yearning carrion crows to crave the rewards of battle."

    "And we're the rewards," added the fourth man, dryly.

    The second man broke his silence suddenly, and shifted his bulk angrily, so that the chair
    creaked under him. "But why talk of that. The Empire can't win, can it? There is Seldon's
    assurance that we will form the Second Empire in the end. This is only another crisis. There
    have been three before this."

    "Only another crisis, yes!" Forell brooded. "But - in the case of the first two, we had Salvor
    Hardin to guide us; in the third, there was Hober Mallow. Whom have we now?"



    He looked at the others somberly and continued, "Seldon's rules of psychohistory on which it is
    so comforting to rely probably have as one of the contributing variables, a certain normal
    initiative on the part of the people of the Foundation themselves. Seldon's laws help those who
    help themselves."

    "The times make the man," said the third man. "There's another proverb for you."

    "You can't count on that, not with absolute assurance," grunted Forell. "Now the way it seems
    to me is this. If this is the fourth crisis, then Seldon has foreseen it. If he has, then it can be
    beaten, and there should be a way of doing it.

    "Now The Empire is stronger than we; it always has been. But this is the first time we are in
    danger of its direct attack, so that strength becomes terribly menacing. If it can be beaten, it
    must be once again as in all past crises by a method other than pure force. We must find the
    weak side of our enemy and attack it there."

    "And what is that weak side?" asked the fourth man. "Do you intend advancing a theory?"

    "No. That is the point I'm leading up to. Our great leaders of the past always saw the weak
    points of their enemies and aimed at that. But now-"

    There was a helplessness in his voice, and for a moment none volunteered a comment.

    Then the fourth man said, "We need spies."

    Forell turned to him eagerly. "Right! I don't know when the Empire will attack. There may be
    time."

    "Hober Mallow himself entered the Imperial dominions," suggested the second man.

    But Forell shook his head. "Nothing so direct. None of us are precisely youthful; and all of us
    are rusty with red-tape and administrative detail. We need young men that are in the field
    now-"

    "The independent traders?" asked the fourth man.

    And Forell nodded his, head and whispered, "If there is yet time-"


    3. THE DEAD HAND


    Bel Riose interrupted his annoyed stridings to look up hopefully when his aide entered. "Any
    word of the Starlet ?"

    "None. The scouting party has quartered space, but the instruments have detected nothing.
    Commander Yume has reported that the Fleet is ready for an immediate attack in retaliation."

    The general shook his head. "No, not for a patrol ship. Not yet. Tell him to double - Wait! I'll
    write out the message. Have it coded and transmitted by tight beam."

    He wrote as he talked and thrust the paper at the waiting officer. "Has the Siwennian arrived



    yet?"

    "Not yet."

    "Well, see to it that he is brought in here as soon as he does arrive."

    The aide saluted crisply and left. Riose resumed his caged stride.

    When the door opened a second time, it was Ducem Barr that stood on the threshold. Slowly,
    in the footsteps of the ushering aide, he stepped into the garish room whose ceiling was an
    ornamented holographic model of the Galaxy, and in the center of which Bel Riose stood in
    field uniform.

    "Patrician, good day!" The general pushed forward a chair with his foot and gestured the aide
    away with a "That door is to stay closed till I open it."

    He stood before the Siwennian, legs apart, hand grasping wrist behind his back, balancing
    himself slowly, thoughtfully, on the balls of his feet.

    Then, harshly, "Patrician, are you a loyal subject of the Emperor?"

    Barr, who had maintained an indifferent silence till then, wrinkled a noncommittal brow. "I have
    no cause to love Imperial rule."

    "Which is a long way from saying that you would be a traitor."

    "True. But the mere act of not being a traitor is also a long way from agreeing to be an active
    helper."

    "Ordinarily also true. But to refuse your help at this point," said Riose, deliberately, "will be
    considered treason and treated as such."

    Barr's eyebrows drew together. "Save your verbal cudgels for your subordinates. A simple
    statement of your needs and wants will suffice me here."

    Riose sat down and crossed his legs. "Barr, we had an earlier discussion half a year ago."
    "About your magicians?"

    "Yes. You remember what I said I would do."

    Barr nodded. His arms rested limply in his lap. "You were going to visit them in their haunts,
    and you've been away these four months. Did you find them?"

    "Find them? That I did," cried Riose. His lips were stiff as he spoke. It seemed to require effort
    to refrain from grinding molars. "Patrician, they are not magicians; they are devils. It is as far
    from belief as the outer galaxies from here. Conceive it! It is a world the size of a handkerchief,
    of a fingernail; with resources so petty, power so minute, a population so microscopic as would
    never suffice the most backward worlds of the dusty prefects of the Dark Stars. Yet with that, a
    people so proud and ambitious as to dream quietly and methodically of Galactic rule.

    "Why, they are so sure of themselves that they do not even hurry. They move slowly,



    phlegmatically; they speak of necessary centuries. They swallow worlds at leisure; creep
    through systems with dawdling complacence.

    "And they succeed. There is no one to stop them. They have built up a filthy trading community
    that curls its tentacles about the systems further than their toy ships dare reach. For parsecs,
    their Traders - which is what their agents call themselves - penetrate."

    Ducem Barr interrupted the angry flow. "How much of this information is definite; and how much
    is simply fury?"

    The soldier caught his breath and grew calmer. "My fury does not blind me. I tell you I was in
    worlds nearer to Siwenna than to the Foundation, where the Empire was a myth of the
    distance, and where Traders were living truths. We ourselves were mistaken for Traders."

    "The Foundation itself told you they aimed at Galactic dominion?"

    "Told me!" Riose was violent again. "It was not a matter of telling me. The officials said nothing.
    They spoke business exclusively. But I spoke to ordinary men. I absorbed the ideas of the
    common folk; their 'manifest destiny,' their calm acceptance of a great future. It is a thing that
    can't be hidden; a universal optimism they don't even try to hide."

    The Siwennian openly displayed a certain quiet satisfaction. "You will notice that so far it would
    seem to bear out quite accurately my reconstruction of events from the paltry data on the
    subject that I have gathered."

    "It is no doubt," replied Riose with vexed sarcasm, "a tribute to your analytical powers. It is also
    a hearty and bumptious commentary on the growing danger to the domains of His Imperial
    Majesty."

    Barr shrugged his unconcern, and Riose leaned forward suddenly, to seize the old man's
    shoulders and stare with curious gentleness into his eyes.

    He said, "Now, patrician, none of that. I have no desire to be barbaric. For my part, the legacy
    of Siwennian hostility to the Imperium is an odious burden, and one which I would do
    everything in my power to wipe out. But my province is the military and interference in civil
    affairs is impossible. It would bring about my recall and ruin my usefulness at once. You see
    that? I know you see that. Between yourself and myself then, let the atrocity of forty years ago
    be repaid by your vengeance upon its author and so forgotten. I need your help. I frankly admit
    it."

    There was a world of urgency in the young man's voice, but Ducem Barr's head shook gently
    and deliberately in a negative gesture.

    Riose said pleadingly, "You don't understand, patrician, and I doubt my ability to make you. I
    can't argue on your ground. You're the scholar, not I. But this I can tell you. Whatever you think
    of the Empire, you will admit its great services. Its armed forces have committed isolated
    crimes, but in the main they have been a force for peace and civilization. It was the Imperial
    navy that created the Pax Imperium that ruled over all the Galaxy for thousands of years.
    Contrast the millennia of peace under the Sun-and-Spaceship of the Empire with the millennia
    of interstellar anarchy that preceded it. Consider the wars and devastations of those old days



    and tell me if, with all its faults, the Empire is not worth preserving.

    "Consider," he drove on forcefully, "to what the outer fringe of the Galaxy is reduced in these
    days of their breakaway and independence, and ask yourself if for the sake of a petty revenge
    you would reduce Siwenna from its position as a province under the protection of a mighty
    Navy to a barbarian world in a barbarian Galaxy, all immersed in its fragmentary independence
    and its common degradation and misery."

    "Is it so bad - so soon?" murmured the Siwennian.

    "No," admitted Riose. "We would be safe ourselves no doubt, were our lifetimes quadrupled.

    But it is for the Empire I fight; that, and a military tradition which is something for myself alone,
    and which I can not transfer to you. It is a military tradition built on the Imperial institution which
    I serve."

    "You are getting mystical, and I always find it difficult to penetrate another person's mysticism."
    "No matter. You understand the danger of this Foundation."

    "It was I who pointed out what you call the danger before ever you headed outward from
    Siwenna."

    "Then you realize that it must be stopped in embryo or perhaps not at all. You have known of
    this Foundation before anyone had heard of it. You know more about it than anyone else in the
    Empire. You probably know how it might best be attacked; and you can probably forewarn me
    of its countermeasures. Come, let us be friends."

    Ducem Barr rose. Fie said flatly, "Such help as I could give you means nothing. So I will make
    you free of it in the face of your strenuous demand."

    "I will be the judge of its meaning."

    "No, I am serious. Not all the might of the Empire could avail to crush this pygmy world."

    "Why not?" Bel Riose's eyes glistened fiercely. "No, stay where you are. I'll tell you when you
    may leave. Why not? If you think I underestimate this enemy I have discovered, you are wrong.
    Patrician," he spoke reluctantly, "I lost a ship on my return. I have no proof that it fell into the
    hands of the Foundation; but it has not been located since and were it merely an accident, its
    dead hulk should, certainly have been found along the route we took. It is not an important loss
    - less than the tenth part of a fleabite, but it may mean that the Foundation has already opened
    hostilities. Such eagerness and such disregard for consequences might mean secret forces of
    which I know nothing. Can you help me then by answering a specific question? What is their
    military power?"

    "I haven't any notion."

    "Then explain yourself on your own terms. Why do you say the Empire can not defeat this small
    enemy?"

    The Siwennian seated himself once more and looked away from Riose's fixed glare. Fie spoke
    heavily, "Because I have faith in the principles of psychohistory. It is a strange science. It



    reached mathematical maturity with one man, Hari Seldon, and died with him, for no man since
    has been capable of manipulating its intricacies. But in that short period, it proved itself the
    most powerful instrument ever invented for the study of humanity. Without pretending to predict
    the actions of individual humans, it formulated definite laws capable of mathematical analysis
    and extrapolation to govern and predict the mass action of human groups."

    "So-"

    "It was that psychohistory which Seldon and the group he worked with applied in full force to
    the establishment of the Foundation. The place, time, and conditions all conspire
    mathematically and so, inevitably, to the development of a Second Galactic Empire."

    Riose's voice trembled with indignation. "You mean that this art of his predicts that I would
    attack the Foundation and lose such and such a battle for such and such a reason? You are
    trying to say that I am a silly robot following a predetermined course into destruction."

    "No," replied the old patrician, sharply. "I have already said that the science had nothing to do
    with individual actions. It is the vaster background that has been foreseen."

    "Then we stand clasped tightly in the forcing hand of the Goddess of Historical Necessity."

    "Of Psyc/7ohistorical Necessity," prompted Barr, softly.

    "And if I exercise my prerogative of freewill? If I choose to attack next year, or not to attack at
    all? Flow pliable is the Goddess? Flow resourceful?"

    Barr shrugged. "Attack now or never; with a single ship, or all the force in the Empire; by
    military force or economic pressure; by candid declaration of war or by treacherous ambush.

    Do whatever you wish in your fullest exercise of freewill. You will still lose."

    "Because of Hari Seldon's dead hand?"

    "Because of the dead hand of the mathematics of human behavior that can neither be stopped,
    swerved, nor delayed."

    The two faced each other in deadlock, until the general stepped back.

    Fie said simply, "I'll take that challenge. It's a dead hand against a living will."


    4. THE EMPEROR

    CLEON II commonly called "The Great. " The last strong Emperor of the First Empire, he is
    important for the political and artistic renaissance that took place during his long reign. He is
    best known to romance, however, for his connection with Bel Riose, and to the common man,
    he is simply "Riose's Emperor. " It is important not to allow events of the last year of his reign to
    overshadow forty years of...


    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA



    Cleon II was Lord of the Universe. Cleon II also suffered from a painful and undiagnosed
    ailment. By the queer twists of human affairs, the two statements are not mutually exclusive,
    nor even particularly incongruous. There have been a wearisomely large number of precedents
    in history.

    But Cleon II cared nothing for such precedents. To meditate upon a long list of similar cases
    would not ameliorate personal suffering an electron's worth. It soothed him as little to think that
    where his great-grandfather had been the pirate ruler of a dust-speck planet, he himself slept in
    the pleasure palace of Ammenetik the Great, as heir of a line of Galactic rulers stretching
    backward into a tenuous past. It was at present no source of comfort to him that the efforts of
    his father had cleansed the realm of its leprous patches of rebellion and restored it to the peace
    and unity it had enjoyed under Stanel VI; that, as a consequence, in the twenty-five years of his
    reign, not one cloud of revolt had misted his burnished glory.

    The Emperor of the Galaxy and the Lord of All whimpered as he lolled his head backward into
    the invigorating plane of force about his pillows. It yielded in a softness that did not touch, and
    at the pleasant tingle, Cleon relaxed a bit. He sat up with difficulty and stared morosely at the
    distant walls of the grand chamber. It was a bad room to be alone in. It was too big. All the
    rooms were too big.

    But better to be alone during these crippling bouts than to endure the prinking of the courtiers,
    their lavish sympathy, their soft, condescending dullness. Better to be alone than to watch
    those insipid masks behind which spun the tortuous speculations on the chances of death and
    the fortunes of the succession.

    His thoughts hurried him. There were his three sons; three straight-backed youths full of
    promise and virtue. Where did they disappear on these bad days? Waiting, no doubt. Each
    watching the other; and all watching him.

    He stirred uneasily. And now Brodrig craved audience. The low-born, faithful Brodrig; faithful
    because he was hated with a unanimous and cordial hatred that was the only point of
    agreement between the dozen cliques that divided his court.

    Brodrig - the faithful favorite, who had to be faithful, since unless he owned the fastest
    speed-ship in the Galaxy and took to it the day of the Emperor's death, it would be the
    radiation-chamber the day after.

    Cleon II touched the smooth knob on the arm of his great divan, and the huge door at the end
    of the room dissolved to transparency.

    Brodrig advanced along the crimson carpet, and knelt to kiss the Emperor's limp hand.

    "Your health, sire?" asked the Privy Secretary in a low tone of becoming anxiety.

    "I live," snapped the Emperor with exasperation, "if you can call it life where every scoundrel
    who can read a book of medicine uses me as a blank and receptive field for his feeble
    experiments. If there is a conceivable remedy, chemical, physical, or nuclear, which has not yet
    been tried, why then, some learned babbler from the far comers of the realm will arrive
    tomorrow to try it. And still another newly-discovered book, or forgery morelike, will be used as



    authority.

    "By my father's memory," he rumbled savagely, "it seems there is not a biped extant who can
    study a disease before his eyes with those same eyes. There is not one who can count a
    pulse-beat without a book of the ancients before him. I'm sick and they call it 'unknown.' The
    fools! If in the course of millennia, human bodies learn new methods of falling askew, it remains
    uncovered by the studies of the ancients and uncurable forevermore. The ancients should be
    alive now, or I then."

    The Emperor ran down to a low-breathed curse while Brodrig waited dutifully. Cleon II said
    peevishly, "How many are waiting outside?"

    He jerked his head in the direction of the door.

    Brodrig said patiently, "The Great Hall holds the usual number."

    "Well, let them wait. State matters occupy me. Have the Captain of the Guard announce it. Or
    wait, forget the state matters. Just have it announced I hold no audience, and let the Captain of
    the Guard look doleful. The jackals among them may betray themselves." The Emperor
    sneered nastily.

    "There is a rumor, sire," said Brodrig, smoothly, "that it is your heart that troubles you."

    The Emperor's smile was little removed from the previous sneer. "It will hurt others more than
    myself if any act prematurely on that rumor. But what is it you want. Let's have this over."

    Brodrig rose from his kneeling posture at a gesture of permission and said, "It concerns
    General Bel Riose, the Military Governor of Siwenna."

    "Riose?" Cleon II frowned heavily. "I don't place him. Wait, is he the one who sent that quixotic
    message some months back? Yes, I remember. He panted for permission to enter a career of
    conquest for the glory of the Empire and Emperor."

    "Exactly, sire."

    The Emperor laughed shortly. "Did you think I had such generals left me, Brodrig? He seems to
    be a curious atavism. What was the answer? I believe you took care of it."

    "I did, sire. He was instructed to forward additional information and to take no steps involving
    naval action without further orders from the Imperium."

    "Hmp. Safe enough. Who is this Riose? Was he ever at court?"

    Brodrig nodded and his mouth twisted ever so little. "He began his career as a cadet in the
    Guards ten years back. He had part in that affair off the Lemul Cluster."

    "The Lemul Cluster? You know, my memory isn't quite - Was that the time a young soldier
    saved two ships of the line from a head-on collision by ... uh ... something or other?" He waved
    a hand impatiently. "I don't remember the details. It was something heroic."

    "Riose was that soldier. He received a promotion for it," Brodrig said dryly, "and an appointment



    to field duty as captain of a ship."

    "And now Military Governor of a border system and still young. Capable man, Brodrig!"

    "Unsafe, sire. He lives in the past. He is a dreamer of ancient times, or rather, of the myths of
    what ancient times used to be. Such men are harmless in themselves, but their queer lack of
    realism makes them fools for others." He added, "His men, I understand, are completely under
    his control. He is one of your popular generals."

    "Is he?" the Emperor mused. "Well, come, Brodrig, I would not wish to be served entirely by
    incompetents. They certainly set no enviable standard for faithfulness themselves."

    "An incompetent traitor is no danger. It is rather the capable men who must be watched."

    "You among them, Brodrig?" Cleon II laughed and then grimaced with pain. "Well, then, you
    may forget the lecture for the while. What new development is there in the matter of this young
    conqueror? I hope you haven't come merely to reminisce."

    "Another message, sire, has been received from General Riose."

    "Oh? And to what effect?"

    "He has spied out the land of these barbarians and advocates an expedition in force. His
    arguments are long and fairly tedious. It is not worth annoying Your Imperial Majesty with it at
    present, during your indisposition. Particularly since it will be discussed at length during the
    session of the Council of Lords." He glanced sidewise at the Emperor.

    Cleon II frowned. "The Lords? Is it a question for them, Brodrig? It will mean further demands
    for a broader interpretation of the Charter. It always comes to that."

    "It can't be avoided, sire. It might have been better if your august father could have beaten
    down the last rebellion without granting the Charter. But since it is here, we must endure it for
    the while."

    "You're right, I suppose. Then the Lords it must be. But why all this solemnity, man? It is, after
    all, a minor point. Success on a remote border with limited troops is scarcely a state affair."

    Brodrig smiled narrowly. He said coolly, "It is an affair of a romantic idiot; but even a romantic
    idiot can be a deadly weapon when an unromantic rebel uses him as a tool. Sire, the man was
    popular here and is popular there. He is young. If he annexes a vagrant barbarian planet or
    two, he will become a conqueror. Now a young conqueror who has proven his ability to rouse
    the enthusiasm of pilots, miners, tradesmen and suchlike rabble is dangerous at any time. Even
    if he lacked the desire to do to you as your august father did to the usurper, Ricker, then one of
    our loyal Lords of the Domain may decide to use him as his weapon."

    Cleon II moved an arm hastily and stiffened with pain. Slowly he relaxed, but his smile was
    weak, and his voice a whisper. "You are a valuable subject, Brodrig. You always suspect far
    more than is necessary, and I have but to take half your suggested precautions to be utterly
    safe. We'll put it up to the Lords. We shall see what they say and take our measure accordingly.
    The young man, I suppose, has made no hostile moves yet."



    "He report none. But already he asks for reinforcements."

    "Reinforcements!" The Emperor's eyes narrowed with wonder. "What force has he?"

    "Ten ships of the line, sire, with a full complement of auxiliary vessels. Two of the ships are
    equipped with motors salvaged from the old Grand Fleet, and one has a battery of power
    artillery from the same source. The other ships are new ones of the last fifty years, but are
    serviceable, nevertheless."

    "Ten ships would seem adequate for any reasonable undertaking. Why, with less than ten ships
    my father won his first victories against the usurper. Who are these barbarians he's fighting?"

    The Privy Secretary raised a pair of supercilious eyebrows. "He refers to them as 'the
    Foundation.'"

    "The Foundation? What is it?"

    "There is no record of it, sire. I have searched the archives carefully. The area of the Galaxy
    indicated falls within the ancient province of Anacreon, which two centuries since gave itself up
    to brigandage, barbarism, and anarchy. There is no planet known as Foundation in the
    province, however. There was a vague reference to a group of scientists sent to that province
    just before its separation from our protection. They were to prepare an Encyclopedia." He
    smiled thinly. "I believe they called it the Encyclopedia Foundation."

    "Well," the Emperor considered it somberly, "that seems a tenuous connection to advance."

    "I'm not advancing it, sire. No word was ever received from that expedition after the growth of
    anarchy in that region. If their descendants still live and retain their name, then they have
    reverted to barbarism most certainly."

    "And so he wants reinforcements." The Emperor bent a fierce glance at his secretary. "This is
    most peculiar; to propose to fight savages with ten ships and to ask for more before a blow is
    struck. And yet I begin to remember this Riose; he was a handsome boy of loyal family.

    Brodrig, there are complications in this that I don't penetrate. There may be more importance in
    it than would seem."

    His fingers played idly with the gleaming sheet that covered his stiffened legs. He said, "I need
    a man out there; one with eyes, brains and loyalty. Brodrig-"

    The secretary bent a submissive head. "And the ships, sire?"

    "Not yet!" The Emperor moaned softly as he shifted his position in gentle stages. He pointed a
    feeble finger, "Not till we know more. Convene the Council of Lords for this day week. It will be
    a good opportunity for the new appropriation as well. I'll put that through or lives will end."

    He leaned his aching head into the soothing tingle of the force-field pillow, "Go now, Brodrig,
    and send in the doctor. He's the worst bumbler of the lot."



    5. THE WAR BEGINS

    From the radiating point of Siwenna, the forces of the Empire reached out cautiously into the
    black unknown of the Periphery. Giant ships passed the vast distances that separated the
    vagrant stars at the Galaxy's rim, and felt their way around the outermost edge of Foundation
    influence.

    Worlds isolated in their new barbarism of two centuries felt the sensation once again of Imperial
    overlords upon their soil. Allegiance was sworn in the face of the massive artillery covering
    capital cities.

    Garrisons were left; garrisons of men in Imperial uniform with the Spaceship-and-Sun insignia
    upon their shoulders. The old men took notice and remembered once again the forgotten tales
    of their grandfathers' fathers of the times when the universe was big, and rich, and peaceful
    and that same Spaceship-and-Sun ruled all.

    Then the great ships passed on to weave their line of forward bases further around the
    Foundation. And as each world was knotted into its proper place in the fabric, the report went
    back to Bel Riose at the General Fleadquarters he had established on the rocky barrenness of
    a wandering sunless planet.

    Now Riose relaxed and smiled grimly at Ducem Barr. "Well, what do you think, patrician?"

    "I? Of what value are my thoughts? I am not a military man." He took in with one wearily
    distasteful glance the crowded disorder of the rock-bound room which had been carved out of
    the wall of a cavern of artificial air, light, and heat which marked the single bubble of life in the
    vastness of a bleak world.

    "For the help I could give you," he muttered, "or would want to give you, you might return me to
    Siwenna."

    "Not yet. Not yet." The general turned his chair to the comer which held the huge,
    brilliantly-transparent sphere that mapped the old Imperial prefect of Anacreon and its
    neighboring sectors. "Later, when this is over, you will go back to your books and to more. I'll
    see to it that the estates of your family are restored to you and to your children for the rest of
    time."

    "Thank you," said Barr, with faint irony, "but I lack your faith in the happy outcome of all this."

    Riose laughed harshly, "Don't start your prophetic croakings again. This map speaks louder
    than all your woeful theories." He caressed its curved invisible outline gently. "Can you read a
    map in radial projection? You can? Well, here, see for yourself. The stars in gold represent the
    Imperial territories. The red stars are those in subjection to the Foundation and the pink are
    those which are probably within the economic sphere of influence. Now watch-"

    Riose's hand covered a rounded knob, and slowly an area of hard, white pinpoints changed into
    a deepening blue. Like an inverted cup they folded about the red and the pink.

    "Those blue stars have been taken over by my forces," said Riose with quiet satisfaction, "and



    they still advance. No opposition has appeared anywhere. The barbarians are quiet. And
    particularly, no opposition has come from Foundation forces. They sleep peacefully and well."

    "You spread your force thinly, don't you?" asked Barr.

    "As a matter of fact," said Riose, "despite appearances, I don't. The key points which I garrison
    and fortify are relatively few, but they are carefully chosen. The result is that the force
    expended is small, but the strategic result great. There are many advantages, more than would
    ever appear to anyone who hasn't made a careful study of spatial tactics, but it is apparent to
    anyone, for instance, that I can base an attack from any point in an inclosing sphere, and that
    when I am finished it will be impossible for the Foundation to attack at flank or rear. I shall have
    no flank or rear with respect to them.

    "This strategy of the Previous Enclosure has been tried before, notably in the campaigns of
    Loris VI, some two thousand years ago, but always imperfectly; always with the knowledge and
    attempted interference of the enemy. This is different."

    "The ideal textbook case?" Barr's voice was languid and indifferent.

    Riose was impatient, "You still think my forces will fail?"

    "They must."

    "You understand that there is no case in military history where an Enclosure has been
    completed that the attacking forces have not eventually won, except where an outside Navy
    exists in sufficient force to break the Enclosure."

    "If you say so."

    "And you still adhere to your faith."

    "Yes."

    Riose shrugged. "Then do so."

    Barr allowed the angry silence to continue for a moment, then asked quietly, "Flave you
    received an answer from the Emperor?"

    Riose removed a cigarette from a wall container behind his head, placed a filter tip between his
    lips and puffed it aflame carefully. Fie said, "You mean my request for reinforcements? It came,
    but that's all. Just the answer."

    "No ships."

    "None. I half-expected that. Frankly, patrician, I should never have allowed myself to be
    stampeded by your theories into requesting them in the first place. It puts me in a false light."

    "Does it?"

    "Definitely. Ships are at a premium. The civil wars of the last two centuries have smashed up
    more than half of the Grand Fleet and what's left is in pretty shaky condition. You know it isn't
    as if the ships we build these days are worth anything. I don't think there's a man in the Galaxy



    today who can build a first-rate hypernuclear motor."

    "I knew that," said the Siwennian. His eyes were thoughtful and introspective. "I didn't know that
    yoi/knew it. So his Imperial Majesty can spare no ships. Psychohistory could have predicted
    that; in fact, it probably did. I should say that Hari Seldon's dead hand wins the opening round."

    Riose answered sharply, "I have enough ships as it is. Your Seldon wins nothing. Should the
    situation turn more serious, then more ships will be available. As yet, the Emperor does not
    know all the story."

    "Indeed? What haven't you told him?"

    "Obviously - your theories." Riose looked sardonic. "The story is, with all respect to you,
    inherently improbable. If developments warrant; if events supply me with proof, then, but only
    then, would I make out the case of mortal danger.

    "And in addition," Riose drove on, casually, "the story, unbolstered by fact, has a flavor of lese
    majeste that could scarcely be pleasant to His Imperial Majesty."

    The old patrician smiled. "You mean that telling him his august throne is in danger of
    subversion by a parcel of ragged barbarians from the ends of the universe is not a warning to
    be believed or appreciated. Then you expect nothing from him."

    "Unless you count a special envoy as something."

    "And why a special envoy?"

    "It's an old custom. A direct representative of the crown is present on every military campaign
    which is under government auspices."

    "Really? Why?"

    "It's a method of preserving the symbol of personal Imperial leadership in all campaigns. It's
    gained a secondary function of insuring the fidelity of generals. It doesn't always succeed in
    that respect."

    "You'll find that inconvenient, general. Extraneous authority, I mean."

    "I don't doubt that," Riose reddened faintly, "but it can't be helped-"

    The receiver at the general's hand glowed warmly, and with an unobtrusive jar, the cylindered
    communication popped into its slot. Riose unrolled it, "Good! This is it!"

    Ducem Barr raised a mildly questioning eyebrow.

    Riose said, "You know we've captured one of these Trader people. Alive - and with his ship
    intact."

    "I've heard talk of it."

    "Well, they've just brought him in, and we'll have him here in a minute. You keep your seat,
    patrician. I want you here when I'm questioning him. It's why I asked you here today in the first



    place. You may understand him where I might miss important points."

    The door signal sounded and a touch of the general's toe swung the door wide. The man who
    stood on the threshold was tall and bearded, wore a short coat of a soft, leathery plastic, with
    an attached hood shoved back on his neck. His hands were free, and if he noticed the men
    about him were armed, he did not trouble to indicate it.

    He stepped in casually, and looked about with calculating eyes. He favored the general with a
    rudimentary wave of the hand and a half nod.

    "Your name?" demanded Riose, crisply.

    "Lathan Devers." The trader hooked his thumbs into his wide and gaudy belt. "Are you the boss
    here?"

    "You are a trader of the Foundation?"

    "That's right. Listen, if you're the boss, you'd better tell your hired men here to lay off my cargo."

    The general raised his head and regarded the prisoner coldly. "Answer questions. Do not
    volunteer orders."

    "All right. I'm agreeable. But one of your boys blasted a two-foot hole in his chest already, by
    sticking his fingers where he wasn't supposed to."

    Riose shifted his gaze to the lieutenant in charge. "Is this man telling the truth? Your report,
    Vrank, had it that no lives were lost."

    "None were, sir," the lieutenant spoke stiffly, apprehensively, "at the time. There was later some
    disposition to search the ship, there having arisen a rumor that a woman was aboard. Instead,
    sir, many instruments of unknown nature were located, instruments which the prisoner claims
    to be his stock in trade. One of them flashed on handling, and the soldier holding it died."

    The general turned back to the trader. "Does your ship carry nuclear explosives?"

    "Galaxy, no. What for? That fool grabbed a nuclear puncher, wrong end forward and set at
    maximum dispersion. You're not supposed to do that. Might as well point a neut-gun at your
    head. I'd have stopped him, if five men weren't sitting on my chest."

    Riose gestured at the waiting guard, "You go. The captured ship is to he sealed against all
    intrusion. Sit down, Devers."

    The trader did so, in the spot indicated, and withstood stolidly the hard scrutiny of the Imperial
    general and the curious glance of the Siwennian patrician.

    Riose said, "You're a sensible man, Devers."

    "Thank you. Are you impressed by my face, or do you want something? Tell you what, though.
    I'm a good business man."

    "It's about the same thing. You surrendered your ship when you might have decided to waste
    our ammunition and have yourself blown to electron-dust. It could result in good treatment for



    you, if you continue that sort of outlook on life."

    "Good treatment is what I mostly crave, boss."

    "Good, and co-operation is what I mostly crave." Riose smiled, and said in a low aside to
    Ducem Barr, "I hope the word 'crave' means what I think it does. Did you ever hear such a
    barbarous jargon?"

    Devers said blandly, "Right. I check you. But what kind of co-operation are you talking about,
    boss? To tell you straight, I don't know where I stand." He looked about him, "Where's this
    place, for instance, and - what's the idea?"

    "Ah, I've neglected the other half of the introductions. I apologize." Riose was in good humor.
    "That gentleman is Ducem Barr, Patrician of the Empire. I am Bel Riose, Peer of the Empire,
    and General of the Third Class in the armed forces of His Imperial Majesty."

    The trader's jaw slackened. Then, "The Empire? I mean the old Empire they taught us about at
    school? Huh! Funny! I always had the sort of notion that it didn't exist any more."

    "Look about you. It does," said Riose grimly.

    "Might have known it though," and Lathan Devers pointed his beard at the ceiling. "That was a
    mightily polished-looking set of craft that took my tub. No kingdom of the Periphery could have
    turned them out." His brow furrowed. "So what's the game, boss? Or do I call you general?"

    "Me game is war."

    "Empire versus Foundation, that it?"

    "Right."

    "Why?"

    "I think you know why."

    The trader stared sharply and shook his head.

    Riose let the other deliberate, then said softly, "I'm sure you know why."

    Lathan Devers muttered, "Warm here," and stood up to remove his hooded jacket. Then he sat
    down again and stretched his legs out before him.

    "You know," he said, comfortably, "I figure you're thinking I ought to jump up with a whoop and
    lay about me. I can catch you before you could move if I choose my time, and this old fellow
    who sits there and doesn't say anything couldn't do much to stop me."

    "But you won't," said Riose, confidently.

    "I won't," agreed Devers, amiably. "First off, killing you wouldn't stop the war, I suppose. There
    are more generals where you came from."

    "Very accurately calculated."



    "Besides which, I'd probably be slammed down about two seconds after I got you, and killed
    fast, or maybe slow, depending. But I'd be killed, and I never like to count on that when I'm
    making plans. It doesn't pay off."

    "I said you were a sensible man."

    "But there's one thing I would like, boss. I'd like you to tell me what you mean when you say I
    know why you're jumping us. I don't; and guessing games bother me no end."

    "Yes? Ever hear of Hari Seldon?"

    "No. I said I don't like guessing games."

    Riose flicked a side glance at Ducem Barr who smiled with a narrow gentleness and resumed
    his inwardly-dreaming expression.

    Riose said with a grimace, "Don't you play games, Devers. There is a tradition, or a fable, or
    sober history - I don't care what - upon your Foundation, that eventually you will found the
    Second Empire. I know quite a detailed version of Hari Seldon's psychohistorical claptrap, and
    your eventual plans of aggression against the Empire."

    "That so?" Devers nodded thoughtfully. "And who told you all that?"

    "Does that matter?" said Riose with dangerous smoothness. "You're here to question nothing. I
    want what you know about the Seldon Fable."

    "But if it's a Fable-"

    "Don't play with words, Devers."

    "I'm not. In fact, I'll give it to you straight. You know all I know about it. It's silly stuff, half-baked.
    Every world has its yams; you can't keep it away from them. Yes, I've heard that sort of talk;
    Seldon, Second Empire, and so on. They put kids to sleep at night with the stuff. The young
    squirts curl up in the spare rooms with their pocket projectors and suck up Seldon thrillers. But
    it's strictly non-adult. Nonintelligent adult, anyway." The trader shook his head.

    The Imperial general's eyes were dark. "Is that really so? You waste your lies, man. I've been
    on the planet, Terminus. I know your Foundation. I've looked it in the face."

    "And you ask me? Me, when I haven't kept foot on it for two months at a piece in ten years. You
    are wasting your time. But go ahead with your war, if it's fables you're after."

    And Barr spoke for the first time, mildly, "You are so confident then that the Foundation will
    win?"

    The trader turned. He flushed faintly and an old scar on one temple showed whitely, "Hm-m-m,
    the silent partner. How'd you squeeze that out of what I said, doc?"

    Riose nodded very slightly at Barr, and the Siwennian continued in a low voice, "Because the
    notion would bother you if you thought your world might lose this war, and suffer the bitter
    reapings of defeat, I know. My world once did, and still does."



    Lathan Devers fumbled his beard, looked from one of his opponents to the other, then laughed
    shortly. "Does he always talk like that, boss? Listen," he grew serious, "what's defeat? I've seen
    wars and I've seen defeats. What if the winner does take over? Who's bothered? Me? Guys like
    me?" He shook his head in derision.

    "Get this," the trader spoke forcefully and earnestly, "there are five or six fat slobs who usually
    run an average planet. They get the rabbit punch, but I'm not losing peace of mind over them.
    See. The people? The ordinary run of guys? Sure, some get killed, and the rest pay extra taxes
    for a while. But it settles itself out; it runs itself down. And then it's the old situation again with a
    different five or six."

    Ducem Barr's nostrils flared, and the tendons of his old right hand jerked; but he said nothing.

    Lathan Devers' eyes were on him. They missed nothing. He said, "Look. I spend my life in
    space for my five-and-dime gadgets and my beer-and-pretzel kickback from the Combines.
    There's fat fellows back there," his thumb jerked over his shoulder and back, "that sit home and
    collect my year's income every minute - out of skimmings from me and more like me. Suppose
    you run the Foundation. You'll still need us. You'll need us more than ever the Combines do -
    because you'd not know your way around, and we could bring in the hard cash. We'd make a
    better deal with the Empire. Yes, we would; and I'm a man of business. If it adds up to a plus
    mark, I'm for it."

    And he stared at the two with sardonic belligerence.

    The silence remained unbroken for minutes, and then a cylinder rattled into its slot. The general
    flipped it open, glanced at the neat printing and in-circuited the visuals with a sweep.

    "Prepare plan indicating position of each ship in action. Await orders on full-armed defensive."

    He reached for his cape. As he fastened it about his shoulders, he whispered in a stiff-lipped
    monotone to Barr, "I'm leaving this man to you. I'll expect results. This is war and I can be cruel
    to failures. Remember!" He left, with a salute to both.

    Lathan Devers looked after him, "Well, something's hit him where it hurts. What goes on?"

    "A battle, obviously," said Barr, gruffly. "The forces of the Foundation are coming out for their
    first battle. You'd better come along."

    There were armed soldiers in the room. Their bearing was respectful and their faces were hard.
    Devers followed the proud old Siwennian patriarch out of the room.

    The room to which they were led was smaller, barer. It contained two beds, a visi-screen, and
    shower and sanitary facilities. The soldiers marched out, and the thick door boomed hollowly
    shut.

    " Hmp ?' Devers stared disapprovingly about. "This looks permanent."

    "It is," said Barr, shortly. The old Siwennian turned his back.

    The trader said irritably, "What's your game, doc?"



    "I have no game. You're in my charge, that's all."

    The trader rose and advanced. His bulk towered over the unmoving patrician. "Yes? But you're
    in this cell with me and when you were marched here the guns were pointed just as hard at you
    as at me. Listen, you were all boiled up about my notions on the subject of war and peace."

    He waited fruitlessly, "All fight, let me ask you something. You said your country was licked
    once. By whom? Comet people from the outer nebulae?"

    Barr looked up. "By the Empire."

    "That so? Then what are you doing here?"

    Barr maintained an eloquent silence.

    The trader thrust out a lower lip and nodded his head slowly. He slipped off the flat-linked
    bracelet that hugged his fight wrist and held it out. "What do you think of that?" He wore the
    mate to it on his left.

    The Siwennian took the ornament. He responded slowly to the trader's gesture and put it on.
    The odd tingling at the wrist passed away quickly.

    Devers' voice changed at once. "Right, doc, you've got the action now. Just speak casually. If
    this room is wired, they won't get a thing. That's a Field Distorter you've got there; genuine
    Mallow design. Sells for twenty-five credits on any world from here to the outer rim. You get it
    free. Hold your lips still when you talk and take it easy. You've got to get the trick of it."

    Ducem Barr was suddenly weary. The trader's boring eyes were luminous and urging. He felt
    unequal to their demands.

    Barr said, "What do you want?" The words slurred from between unmoving lips.

    "I've told you. You make mouth noises like what we call a patriot. Yet your own world has been
    mashed up by the Empire, and here you are playing ball with the Empire's fair-haired general.
    Doesn't make sense, does it?"

    Barr said, "I have done my part. A conquering Imperial viceroy is dead because of me."

    "That so? Recently?"

    "Forty years ago."

    "Forty ... years ... ago!" The words seemed to have meaning to the trader. He frowned, "That's
    a long time to live on memories. Does that young squirt in the general's uniform know about it?"

    Barr nodded.

    Devers' eyes were dark with thought. "You want the Empire to win?"

    And the old Siwennian patrician broke out in sudden deep anger, "May the Empire and all its
    works perish in universal catastrophe. All Siwenna prays that daily. I had brothers once, a
    sister, a father. But I have children now, grandchildren. The general knows where to find them."



    Devers waited.


    Barr continued in a whisper, "But that would not stop me if the results in view warranted the
    risk. They would know how to die."

    The trader said gently, "You killed a viceroy once, huh? You know, I recognize a few things. We
    once had a mayor, Hober Mallow his name was. He visited Siwenna; that's your world, isn't it?
    He met a man named Barr."

    Ducem Barr stared hard, suspiciously. "What do you know of this?"

    "What every trader on the Foundation knows. You might be a smart old fellow put in here to get
    on my right side. Sure, they'd point guns at you, and you'd hate the Empire and be all-out for its
    smashing. Then I'd fall all over you and pour out my heart to you, and wouldn't the general be
    pleased. There's not much chance of that, doc.

    "But just the same I'd like to have you prove that you're the son of Onum Barr of Siwenna - the
    sixth and youngest who escaped the massacre."

    Ducem Barr's hand shook as he opened the flat metal box in a wall recess. The metal object he
    withdrew clanked softly as he thrust it into the trader's hands. "Look at that," he said.

    Devers stared. He held the swollen central link of the chain close to his eyes and swore softly.
    "That's Mallow's monogram, or I'm a space-struck rookie, and the design is fifty years old if it's
    a day."

    He looked up and smiled.

    "Shake, doc. A man-sized nuclear shield is all the proof I need," and he held out his large hand.


    6. THE FAVORITE

    The tiny ships had appeared out of the vacant depths and darted into the midst of the Armada.
    Without a shot or a burst of energy, they weaved through the ship-swollen area, then blasted
    on and out, while the Imperial wagons turned after them like lumbering beasts. There were two
    noiseless flares that pinpointed space as two of the tiny gnats shriveled in atomic disintegration,
    and the rest were gone.

    The great ships searched, then returned to their original task, and world by world, the great web
    of the Enclosure continued.

    Brodrig's uniform was stately; carefully tailored and as carefully worn. His walk through the
    gardens of the obscure planet Wanda, now temporary Imperial headquarters, was leisurely; his
    expression was somber.

    Bel Riose walked with him, his field uniform open at the collar, and doleful in its monotonous
    gray-black.

    Riose indicated the smooth black bench under the fragrant tree-fern whose large spatulate



    leaves lifted flatly against the white sun. "See that, sir. It is a relic of the Imperium. The
    ornamented benches, built for lovers, linger on, fresh and useful, while the factories and the
    palaces collapse into unremembered ruin."

    He seated himself, while Cleon ll's Privy Secretary stood erect before him and clipped the
    leaves above neatly with precise swings of his ivory staff.

    Riose crossed his legs and offered a cigarette to the other. He fingered one himself as he
    spoke, "It is what one would expect from the enlightened wisdom of His Imperial Majesty to
    send so competent an observer as yourself. It relieves any anxiety I might have felt that the
    press of more important and more immediate business might perhaps force into the shadows a
    small campaign on the Periphery."

    "The eyes of the Emperor are everywhere," said Brodrig, mechanically. "We do not
    underestimate the importance of the campaign; yet still it would seem that too great an
    emphasis is being placed upon its difficulty. Surely their little ships are no such barrier that we
    must move through the intricate preliminary maneuver of an Enclosure."

    Riose flushed, but he maintained his equilibrium. "I can not risk the lives of my men, who are
    few enough, or the destruction of my ships which are irreplaceable, by a too-rash attack. The
    establishment of an Enclosure will quarter my casualties in the ultimate attack, howsoever
    difficult it be. The military reasons for that I took the liberty to explain yesterday."

    "Well, well, I am not a military man. In this case, you assure me that what seems patently and
    obviously right is, in reality, wrong. We will allow that. Yet your caution shoots far beyond that.
    In your second communication, you requested reinforcements. And these, against an enemy
    poor, small, and barbarous, with whom you have had not one' skirmish at the time. To desire
    more forces under the circumstances would savor almost of incapacity or worse, had not your
    earlier career given sufficient proof of your boldness and imagination."

    "I thank you," said the general, coldly, "but I would remind you that there is a difference
    between boldness and blindness. There is a place for a decisive gamble when you know your
    enemy and can calculate the risks at least roughly; but to move at all against an unknown
    enemy is boldness in itself. You might as well ask why the same man sprints safely across an
    obstacle course in the day, and falls over the furniture in his room at night."

    Brodrig swept away the other's words with a neat flirt of the fingers. "Dramatic, but not
    satisfactory. You have been to this barbarian world yourself. You have in addition this enemy
    prisoner you coddle, this trader. Between yourself and the prisoner you are not in a night fog."

    "No? I pray you to remember that a world which has developed in isolation for two centuries
    can not be interpreted to the point of intelligent attack by a month's visit. I am a soldier, not a
    cleft-chinned, barrel-chested hero of a subetheric trimensional thriller. Nor can a single
    prisoner, and one who is an obscure member of an economic group which has no close
    connection with the enemy world introduce me to all the inner secrets of enemy strategy."

    "You have questioned him?"

    "I have."



    Well?


    "It has been useful, but not vitally so. His ship is tiny, of no account. He sells little toys which
    are amusing if nothing else. I have a few of the cleverest which I intend sending to the Emperor
    as curiosities. Naturally, there is a good deal about the ship and its workings which I do not
    understand, but then I am not a tech-man."

    "But you have among you those who are," pointed out Brodrig.

    "I, too, am aware of that," replied the general in faintly caustic tones. "But the fools have far to
    go before they could meet my needs. I have already sent for clever men who can understand
    the workings of the odd nuclear field-circuits the ship contains. I have received no answer."

    "Men of that type can not be spared, general. Surely, there must be one man of your vast
    province who understands nucleics."

    "Were there such a one, I would have him heal the limping, invalid motors that power two of my
    small fleet of ships. Two ships of my meager ten that can not fight a major battle for lack of
    sufficient power supply. One fifth of my force condemned to the carrion activity of consolidating
    positions behind the lines."

    The secretary's fingers fluttered impatiently. "Your position is not unique in that respect,
    general. The Emperor has similar troubles."

    The general threw away his shredded, never-lit cigarette, lit another, and shrugged. "Well, it is
    beside the immediate point, this lack of first-class tech-men. Except that I might have made
    more progress with my prisoner were my Psychic Probe in proper order."

    The secretary's eyebrows lifted. "You have a Probe?"

    "An old one. A superannuated one which fails me the one time I needed it. I set it up during the
    prisoner's sleep, and received nothing. So much for the Probe. I have tried it on my own men
    and the reaction is quite proper, but again there is not one among my staff of tech-men who
    can tell me why it fails upon the prisoner. Ducem Barr, who is a theoretician of parts, though no
    mechanic, says the psychic structure of the prisoner may be unaffected by the Probe since
    from childhood he has been subjected to alien environments and neural stimuli. I don't know.
    But he may yet be useful. I save him in that hope."

    Brodrig leaned on his staff. A shall see if a specialist is available in the capital. In the
    meanwhile, what of this other man you just mentioned, this Siwennian? You keep too many
    enemies in your good graces."

    "He knows the enemy. He, too, I keep for future reference and the help he may afford me."

    "But he is a Siwennian and the son of a proscribed rebel."

    "He is old and powerless, and his family acts as hostage."

    "I see. Yet I think that I should speak to this trader, myself."

    "Certainly."



    "Alone," the secretary added coldly, making his point.

    "Certainly," repeated Riose, blandly. "As a loyal subject of the Emperor, I accept his personal
    representative as my superior. However, since the trader is at the permanent base, you will
    have to leave the front areas at an interesting moment."

    "Yes? Interesting in what way?"

    "Interesting in that the Enclosure is complete today. Interesting in that within the week, the
    Twentieth Fleet of the Border advances inward towards the core of resistance." Riose smiled
    and turned away.

    In a vague way, Brodrig felt punctured.


    7. BRIBERY


    Sergeant Mori Luk made an ideal soldier of the ranks. He came from the huge agricultural
    planets of the Pleiades where only army life could break the bond to the soil and the unavailing
    life of drudgery; and he was typical of that background. Unimaginative enough to face danger
    without fear, he was strong and agile enough to face it successfully. He accepted orders
    instantly, drove the men under him unbendingly and adored his general unswervingly.

    And yet with that, he was of a sunny nature. If he killed a man in the line of duty without a scrap
    of hesitation, it was also without a scrap of animosity.

    That Sergeant Luk should signal at the door before entering was further a sign of tact, for he
    would have been perfectly within his rights to enter without signaling.

    The two within looked up from their evening meal and one reached out with his foot to cut off
    the cracked voice which rattled out of the battered pocket-transmitter with bright liveliness.

    "More books?" asked Lathan Devers.

    The sergeant held out the tightly-wound cylinder of film and scratched his neck. "It belongs to
    Engineer Orre, but he'll have to have it back. He's going to send it to his kids, you know, like
    what you might call a souvenir, you know."

    Ducem Barr turned the cylinder in his hands with interest. "And where did the engineer get it?
    He hasn't a transmitter also, has he?"

    The sergeant shook his head emphatically. He pointed to the knocked-about remnant at the
    foot of the bed. "That's the only one in the place. This fellow, Orre, now, he got that book from
    one of these pig-pen worlds out here we captured. They had it in a big building by itself and he
    had to kill a few of the natives that tried to stop him from taking it."

    He looked at it appraisingly. "It makes a good souvenir - for kids."

    He paused, then said stealthily, "There's big news floating about, by the way. It's only
    scuttlebutt, but even so, it's too good to keep. The general did it again." And he nodded slowly,



    gravely.

    "That so?" said Devers. "And what did he do?"

    "Finished the Enclosure, that's all." The sergeant chuckled with a fatherly pride. "Isn't he the
    corker, though? Didn't he work it fine? One of the fellows who's strong on fancy talk, says it
    went as smooth and even as the music of the spheres, whatever they are."

    "The big offensive starts now?" asked Barr, mildly.

    "Hope so," was the boisterous response. "I want to get back on my ship now that my arm is in
    one piece again. I'm tired of sitting on my scupper out here."

    "So am I," muttered Devers, suddenly and savagely. There was a bit of underlip caught in his
    teeth, and he worried it.

    The sergeant looked at him doubtfully, and said, "I'd better go now. The captain's round is due
    and I'd just as soon he didn't catch me in here."

    He paused at the door. "By the way, sir," he said with sudden, awkward shyness to the trader,

    "I heard from my wife. She says that little freezer you gave me to send her works fine. It doesn't
    cost her anything, and she just about keeps a month's supply of food froze up complete. I
    appreciate it."

    "It's all right. Forget it."

    The great door moved noiselessly shut behind the grinning sergeant.

    Ducem Barr got out of his chair. "Well, he gives us a fair return for the freezer. Let's take a look
    at this new book. Ahh, the title is gone."

    He unrolled a yard or so of the film and looked through at the light. Then he murmured, "Well,
    skewer me through the scupper, as the sergeant says. This is 'The Garden of Summa,'

    Devers."

    "That so?" said the trader, without interest. He shoved aside what was left of his dinner. "Sit
    down, Barr. Listening to this old-time literature isn't doing me any good. You heard what the
    sergeant said?"

    "Yes, I did. What of it?"

    "The offensive will start. And we sit here!"

    "Where do you want to sit?"

    "You know what I mean. There's no use just waiting."

    "Isn't there?" Barr was carefully removing the old film from the transmitter and installing the
    new. "You told me a good deal of Foundation history in the last month, and it seems that the
    great leaders of past crises did precious little more than sit - and wait."

    "Ah, Barr, but they knew where they were going."



    "Did they? I suppose they said they did when it was over, and for all I know maybe they did. But
    there's no proof that things would not have worked out as well or better if they had not known
    where they were going. The deeper economic and sociological forces aren't directed by
    individual men."

    Devers sneered. "No way of telling that things wouldn't have worked out worse, either. You're
    arguing tail-end backwards." His eyes were brooding. "You know, suppose I blasted him?"

    "Whom? Riose?"

    "Yes."

    Barr sighed. His aging eyes were troubled with a reflection of the long past. "Assassination isn't
    the way out, Devers. I once tried it, under provocation, when I was twenty - but it solved
    nothing. I removed a villain from Siwenna, but not the Imperial yoke; and it was the Imperial
    yoke and not the villain that mattered."

    "But Riose is not just a villain, doc. He's the whole blamed army. It would fall apart without him.
    They hang on him like babies. The sergeant out there slobbers every time he mentions him."

    "Even so. There are other armies and other leaders. You must go deeper. There is this Brodrig,
    for instance - no one more than he has the ear of the Emperor. He could demand hundreds of
    ships where Riose must struggle with ten. I know him by reputation."

    "That so? What about him?" The trader's eyes lost in frustration what they gained in sharp
    interest.

    "You want a pocket outline? He's a low-born rascal who has by unfailing flattery tickled the
    whims of the Emperor. He's well-hated by the court aristocracy, vermin themselves, because
    he can lay claim to neither family nor humility. He is the Emperor's adviser in all things, and the
    Emperor's too in the worst things. He is faithless by choice but loyal by necessity. There is not a
    man in the Empire as subtle in villainy or as crude in his pleasures. And they say there is no
    way to the Emperor's favor but through him; and no way to his, but through infamy."

    "Wow!" Devers pulled thoughtfully at his neatly trimmed beard. "And he's the old boy the
    Emperor sent out here to keep an eye on Riose. Do you know I have an idea?"

    "I do now."

    "Suppose this Brodrig takes a dislike to our young Army's Delight?"

    "He probably has already. He's not noted for a capacity for liking."

    "Suppose it gets really bad. The Emperor might hear about it, and Riose might be in trouble."
    "Uh-huh. Quite likely. But how do you propose to get that to happen?"

    "I don't know. I suppose he could be bribed?"

    The patrician laughed gently. "Yes, in a way, but not in the manner you bribed the sergeant -
    not with a pocket freezer. And even if you reach his scale, it wouldn't be worth it. There's
    probably no one so easily bribed, but he lacks even the fundamental honesty of honorable



    corruption. He doesn't stay bribed; not for any sum. Think of something else."

    Devers swung a leg over his knee and his toe nodded quickly and restlessly. "It's the first hint,
    though-"

    He stopped; the door signal was flashing once again, and the sergeant was on the threshold
    once more. He was excited, and his broad face was red and unsmiling.

    "Sir," he began, in an agitated attempt at deference, "I am very thankful for the freezer, and you
    have always spoken to me very fine, although I am only the son of a farmer and you are great
    lords."

    His Pleiades accent had grown thick, almost too much so for easy comprehension; and with
    excitement, his lumpish peasant derivation wiped out completely the soldierly bearing so long
    and so painfully cultivated.

    Barr said softly, "What is it, sergeant?"

    "Lord Brodrig is coming to see you. Tomorrow! I know, because the captain told me to have my
    men ready for dress review tomorrow for ... for him. I thought - I might warn you."

    Barr said, "Thank you, sergeant, we appreciate that. But it's all right, man; no need for-"

    But the look on Sergeant Luk's face was now unmistakably one of fear. He spoke in a rough
    whisper, "You don't hear the stories the men tell about him. He has sold himself to the space
    fiend. No, don't laugh. There are most terrible tales told about him. They say he has men with
    blast-guns who follow him everywhere, and when he wants pleasure, he just tells them to blast
    down anyone they meet. And they do - and he laughs. They say even the Emperor is in terror
    of him, and that he forces the Emperor to raise taxes and won't let him listen to the complaints
    of the people.

    "And he hates the general, that's what they say. They say he would like to kill the general,
    because the general is so great and wise. But he can't because our general is a match for
    anyone and he knows Lord Brodrig is a bad 'un."

    The sergeant blinked; smiled in a sudden incongruous shyness at his own outburst; and
    backed toward the door. He nodded his head, jerkily. "You mind my words. Watch him."

    He ducked out.

    And Devers looked up, hard-eyed. "This breaks things our way, doesn't it, doc?"

    "It depends," said Barr, dryly, "on Brodrig, doesn't it?"

    But Devers was thinking, not listening.

    He was thinking hard.

    Lord Brodrig ducked his head as he stepped into the cramped living quarters of the trading
    ship, and his two armed guards followed quickly, with bared guns and the professionally hard
    scowls of the hired bravos.



    The Privy Secretary had little of the look of the lost soul about him just then. If the space fiend
    had bought him, he had left no visible mark of possession. Rather might Brodrig have been
    considered a breath of court-fashion come to enliven the hard, bare ugliness of an army base.

    The stiff, tight lines of his sheened and immaculate costume gave him the illusion of height,
    from the very top of which his cold, emotionless eyes stared down the declivity of a long nose
    at the trader. The mother-of-pearl ruches at his wrists fluttered filmily as he brought his ivory
    stick to the ground before him and leaned upon it daintily.

    "No," he said, with a little gesture, "you remain here. Forget your toys; I am not interested in
    them."

    He drew forth a chair, dusted it carefully with the iridescent square of fabric attached to the top
    of his white stick, and seated himself. Devers glanced towards the mate to the chair, but
    Brodrig said lazily, "You will stand in the presence of a Peer of the Realm."

    He smiled.

    Devers shrugged. "If you're not interested in my stock in trade, what am I here for?"

    The Privy Secretary waited coldly, and Devers added a slow, "Sir."

    "For privacy," said the secretary. "Now is it likely that I would come two hundred parsecs
    through space to inspect trinkets? It's you I want to see." He extracted a small pink tablet from
    an engraved box and placed it delicately between his teeth. He sucked it slowly and
    appreciatively.

    "For instance," he said, "who are you? Are you really a citizen of this barbarian world that is
    creating all this fury of military frenzy?"

    Devers nodded gravely.

    "And you were really captured by him after the beginning of this squabble he calls a war. I am
    referring to our young general."

    Devers nodded again.

    "So! Very well, my worthy Outlander. I see your fluency of speech is at a minimum. I shall
    smooth the way for you. It seems that our general here is fighting an apparently meaningless
    war with frightful transports of energy - and this over a forsaken fleabite of a world at the end of
    nowhere, which to a logical man would not seem worth a single blast of a single gun. Yet the
    general is not illogical. On the contrary, I would say he was extremely intelligent. Do you follow
    me?"

    "Can't say I do, sir."

    The secretary inspected his fingernails and said, "Listen further, then. The general would not
    waste his men and ships on a sterile feat of glory. I know he talks of glory and of Imperial
    honor, but it is quite obvious that the affectation of being one of the insufferable old demigods
    of the Heroic Age won't wash. There is something more than glory hereand he does take queer,
    unnecessary care of you. Now if you were my prisoner and told me as little of use as you have



    our general, I would slit open your abdomen and strangle you with your own intestines."

    Devers remained wooden. His eyes moved slightly, first to one of the secretary's bully-boys,
    and then to the other. They were ready; eagerly ready.

    The secretary smiled. "Well, now, you're a silent devil. According to the general, even a Psychic
    Probe made no impression, and that was a mistake on his part, by the way, for it convinced me
    that our young military whizz-bang was lying." He seemed in high humor.

    "My honest tradesman," he said, "I have a Psychic Probe of my own, one that ought to suit you
    peculiarly well. You see this-"

    And between thumb and forefinger, held negligently, were intricately designed, pink-and-yellow
    rectangles which were most definitely obvious in identity.

    Devers said so. "It looks like cash," he said.

    "Cash it is - and the best cash of the Empire, for it is backed by my estates, which are more
    extensive than the Emperor's own. A hundred thousand credits. All here! Between two fingers!
    Yours!"

    "For what, sir? I am a good trader, but all trades go in both directions."

    "For what? For the truth! What is the general after? Why is he fighting this war?"

    Lathan Devers sighed, and smoothed his beard thoughtfully.

    "What he's after?" His eyes were following the motions of the secretary's hands as he counted
    the money slowly, bill by bill. "In a word, the Empire."

    "Hmp. How ordinary! It always comes to that in the end. But how? What is the road that leads
    from the Galaxy's edge to the peak of Empire so broadly and invitingly?"

    "The Foundation," said Devers, bitterly, "has secrets. They have books, old books - so old that
    the language they are in is only known to a few of the top men. But the secrets are shrouded in
    ritual and religion, and none may use them. I tried and now I am here - and there is a death
    sentence waiting for me, there."

    "I see. And these old secrets? Come, for one hundred thousand I deserve the intimate details."
    "The transmutation of elements," said Devers, shortly.

    The secretary's eyes narrowed and lost some of their detachment. "I have been told that
    practical transmutation is impossible by the laws of nucleics."

    "So it is, if nuclear forces are used. But the ancients were smart boys. There are sources of
    power greater than the nuclei and more fundamental. If the Foundation used those sources as I
    suggested-"

    Devers felt a soft, creeping sensation in his stomach. The bait was dangling; the fish was
    nosing it.



    The secretary said suddenly, "Continue. The general, I am sure, is aware of a this. But what
    does he intend doing once he finishes this opera-bouffe affair?"

    Devers kept his voice rock-steady. "With transmutation he controls the economy of the whole
    set-up of your Empire. Mineral holdings won't be worth a sneeze when Riose can make
    tungsten out of aluminum and iridium out of iron. An entire production system based on the
    scarcity of certain elements and the abundance of others is thrown completely out of whack.
    There'll be the greatest disjointment the Empire has ever seen, and only Riose will be able to
    stop it. Anc/ there is the question of this new power I mentioned, the use of which won't give
    Riose religious heebies.

    "There's nothing that can stop him now. He's got the Foundation by the back of the neck, and
    once he's finished with it, he'll be Emperor in two years."

    "So." Brodrig laughed lightly. "Iridium out of iron, that's what you said, isn't it? Come, I'll tell you
    a state secret. Do you know that the Foundation has already been in communication with the
    general?"

    Devers' back stiffened.

    "You look surprised. Why not? It seems logical now. They offered him a hundred tons of iridium
    a year to make peace. A hundred tons of iron converted to iridium in violation of their religious
    principles to save their necks. Fair enough, but no wonder our rigidly incorruptible general
    refused - when he can have the iridium and the Empire as well. And poor Cleon called him his
    one honest general. My bewhiskered merchant, you have earned your money."

    He tossed it, and Devers scrambled after the flying bills.

    Lord Brodrig stopped at the door and turned. "One reminder, trader. My playmates with the
    guns here have neither middle ears, tongues, education, nor intelligence. They can neither
    hear, speak, write, nor even make sense to a Psychic Probe. But they are very expert at
    interesting executions. I have bought you, man, at one hundred thousand credits. You will be
    good and worthy merchandise. Should you forget that you are bought at any time and attempt
    to ... say ... repeat our conversation to Riose, you will be executed. But executed my way."

    And in that delicate face there were sudden hard lines of eager cruelty that changed the studied
    smile into a red-lipped snarl. For one fleeting second, Devers saw that space fiend who had
    bought his buyer, look out of his buyer's eyes.

    Silently, he preceded the two thrusting blast-guns of Brodrig's "playmates" to his quarters.

    And to Ducem Barr's question, he said with brooding satisfaction, "No, that's the queerest part
    of it. He bribed me.

    Two months of difficult war had left their mark on Bel Riose. There was heavy-handed gravity
    about him; and he was short-tempered.

    It was with impatience that he addressed the worshiping Sergeant Luk. "Wait outside, soldier,
    and conduct these men back to their quarters when I am through. No one is to enter until I call.
    No one at all, you understand."



    The sergeant saluted himself stiffly out of the room, and Riose with muttered disgust scooped
    up the waiting papers on his desk, threw them into the top drawer and slammed it shut.

    "Take seats," he said shortly, to the waiting two. "I haven't much time. Strictly speaking, I
    shouldn't be here at all, but it is necessary to see you."

    He turned to Ducem Barr, whose long fingers were caressing with interest the crystal cube in
    which was set the simulacrum of the lined, austere face of His Imperial Majesty, Cleon II.

    "In the first place, patrician," said the general, "your Seldon is losing. To be sure, he battles
    well, for these men of the Foundation swarm like senseless bees and fight like madmen. Every
    planet is defended viciously, and once taken, every planet heaves so with rebellion it is as
    much trouble to hold as to conquer. But they are taken, and they are held. Your Seldon is
    losing."

    "But he has not yet lost," murmured Barr politely.

    "The Foundation itself retains less optimism. They offer me millions in order that I may not put
    this Seldon to the final test."

    "So rumor goes."

    "Ah, is rumor preceding me? Does it prate also of the latest?"

    "What is the latest?"

    "Why, that Lord Brodrig, the darling of the Emperor, is now second in command at his own
    request."

    Devers spoke for the first time. "At his own request, boss? How come? Or are you growing to
    like the fellow?" He chuckled.

    Riose said, calmly, "No, can't say I do. It's just that he bought the office at what I considered a
    fair and adequate price."

    "Such as?"

    "Such as a request to the Emperor for reinforcements."

    Devers' contemptuous smile broadened. "'He has communicated with the Emperor, huh? And I
    take it, boss, you're just waiting for these reinforcements, but they'll come any day. Right?"

    "Wrong! They have already come. Five ships of the line; smooth and strong, with a personal
    message of congratulations from the Emperor, and more ships on the way. What's wrong,
    trader?" he asked, sardonically.

    Devers spoke through suddenly frozen lips. "Nothing!"

    Riose strode out from behind his desk and faced the trader, hand on the butt of his blast-gun.

    "I say, what's wrong, trader? The news would seem to disturb you. Surely, you have no sudden
    birth of interest in the Foundation."



    "I haven't."

    "Yes - there are queer points about you."

    "That so, boss?" Devers smiled tightly, and balled the fists in his pockets. "Just you line them
    up and I'll knock them down for you."

    "Here they are. You were caught easily. You surrendered at first blow with a burnt-out shield.
    You're quite ready to desert your world, and that without a price. Interesting, all this, isn't it?"

    "I crave to be on the winning side, boss. I'm a sensible man; you called me that yourself."

    Riose said with tight throatiness, "Granted! Yet no trader since has been captured. No trade
    ship but has had the speed to escape at choice. No trade ship but has had a screen that could
    take all the beating a light cruiser could give it, should it choose to fight. And no trader but has
    fought to death when occasion warranted. Traders have been traced as the leaders and
    instigators of the guerilla warfare on occupied planets and of the flying raids in occupied space.

    "Are you the only sensible man then? You neither fight nor flee, but turn traitor without urging.
    You are unique, amazingly unique - in fact, suspiciously unique."

    Devers said softly, "I take your meaning, but you have nothing on me. I've been here now six
    months, and I've been a good boy."

    "So you have, and I have repaid you by good treatment. I have left your ship undisturbed and
    treated you with every consideration. Yet you fall short. Freely offered information, for instance,
    on your gadgets might have been helpful. The atomic principles on which they are built would
    seem to be used in some of the Foundation's nastiest weapons. Right?"

    "I am only a trader," said Devers, "and not one of these bigwig technicians. I sell the stuff; I
    don't make it."

    "Well, that will be seen shortly. It is what I came here for. For instance, your ship will be
    searched for a personal force-shield. You have never worn one; yet all soldiers of the
    Foundation do. It will be significant evidence that there is information you do not choose to give
    me. Right?"

    There was no answer. He continued, "And there will be more direct evidence. I have brought
    with me the Psychic Probe. It failed once before, but contact with the enemy is a liberal
    education."

    His voice was smoothly threatening and Devers felt the gun thrust hard in his midriff - the
    general's gun, hitherto in its holster.

    The general said quietly, "You will remove your wristband and any other metal ornament you
    wear and give them to me. Slowly! Atomic fields can be distorted, you see, and Psychic Probes
    might probe only into static. That's right.. I'll take it."

    The receiver on the general's desk was glowing and a message capsule clicked into the slot,
    near which Barr stood and still held the trimensional Imperial bust.



    Riose stepped behind his desk, with his blast-gun held ready. He said to Barr, "You too,
    patrician. Your wristband condemns you. You have been helpful earlier, however, and I am not
    vindictive, but I shall judge the fate of your behostaged family by the results of the Psychic
    Probe."

    And as Riose leaned over to take out the message capsule, Barr lifted the crystal-enveloped
    bust of Cleon and quietly and methodically brought it down upon the general's head.

    It happened too suddenly for Devers to grasp. It was as if a sudden demon had grown into the
    old man.

    "Out!" said Barr, in a tooth-clenched whisper. "Quickly!" He seized Riose's dropped blaster and
    buried it in his blouse.

    Sergeant Luk turned as they emerged from the narrowest possible crack of the door.

    Barr said easily, "Lead on, sergeant!"

    Devers closed the door behind him.

    Sergeant Luk led in silence to their quarters, and then, with the briefest pause, continued
    onward, for there was the nudge of a blast-gun muzzle in his ribs, and a hard voice in his ears
    which said, "To the trade ship."

    Devers stepped forward to open the air lock, and Barr said, "Stand where you are, Luk. You've
    been a decent man, and we're not going to kill you."

    But the sergeant recognized the monogram on the gun. He cried in choked fury, "You've killed
    the general."

    With a wild, incoherent yell, he charged blindly upon the blasting fury of the gun and collapsed
    in blasted ruin.

    The trade ship was rising above the dead planet before the signal lights began their eerie blink
    and against the creamy cobweb of the great Lens in the sky which was the Galaxy, other black
    forms rose.

    Devers said grimly, "Hold tight, Barr - and let's see if they've got a ship that can match my
    speed."

    He knew they hadn't!

    And once in open space, the trader's voice seemed lost and dead as he said, "The line I fed
    Brodrig was a little too good. It seems as if he's thrown in with the general."

    Swiftly they raced into the depths of the star-mass that was the Galaxy.



    8. TO TRANTOR

    Devers bent over the little dead globe, watching for a tiny sign of life. The directional control
    was slowly and thoroughly sieving space with its jabbing tight sheaf of signals.

    Barr watched patiently from his seat on the low cot in the comer, He asked, "No more signs of
    them?"

    "The Empire boys? No." The trader growled the words with evident impatience. "We lost the
    scuppers long ago. Space! With the blind jumps we took through hyperspace, it's lucky we
    didn't land up in a sun's belly. They couldn't have followed us even if they outranqed us, which
    they didn't."

    He sat back and loosened his collar with a jerk. "I don't know what those Empire boys have
    done here. I think some of the gaps are out of alignment."

    "I take it, then, you're trying to get to the Foundation."

    "I'm calling the Association - or trying to."

    "The Association? Who are they?"

    "Association of Independent Traders. Never heard of it, huh? Well, you're not alone. We haven't
    made our splash yet!"

    For a while there was a silence that centered about the unresponsive Reception Indicator, and
    Barr said, "Are you within range?"

    "I don't know. I haven't but a small notion where we are, going by dead reckoning. That's why I
    have to use directional control. It could take years, you know."

    "Might it?"

    Barr pointed; and Devers jumped and adjusted his earphones. Within the little murky sphere
    there was a tiny glowing whiteness.

    For half an hour, Devers nursed the fragile, groping thread of communication that reached
    through hyperspace to connect two points that laggard light would take five hundred years to
    bind together.

    Then he sat back, hopelessly. He looked up, and shoved the earphones back.

    "Let's eat, doc. There's a needle-shower you can use if you want to, but go easy on the hot
    water."

    He squatted before one of the cabinets that lined one wall and felt through the contents. "You're
    not a vegetarian, I hope?"

    Barr said, "I'm omnivorous. But what about the Association. Have you lost them?"

    "Looks so. It was extreme range, a little too extreme. Doesn't matter, though. I got all that
    counted."



    He straightened, and placed the two metal containers upon the table. "Just give it five minutes,
    doc, then slit it open by pushing the contact. It'll be plate, food, and fork - sort of handy for
    when you're in a hurry, if you're not interested in such incidentals as napkins. I suppose you
    want to know what I got out of the Association."

    "If it isn't a secret."

    Devers shook his head. "Not to you. What Riose said was true."

    "About the offer of tribute?"

    "Uh-huh. They offered it, and had it refused. Things are bad. There's fighting in the outer suns
    of Loris."

    "Loris is close to the Foundation?"

    "Huh? Oh, you wouldn't know. It's one of the original Four Kingdoms. You might call it part of
    the inner line of defense. That's not the worst. They've been fighting large ships previously
    never encountered. Which means Riose wasn't giving us the works. He has received more
    ships. Brodrig has switched sides, and I have messed things up."

    His eyes were bleak as he joined the food-container contact-points and watched it fall open
    neatly. The stewlike dish steamed its aroma through the room. Ducem Barr was already eating.

    "So much," said Barr, "for improvisations, then. We can do nothing here; we can not cut
    through the Imperial lines to return to the Foundation; we can do nothing but that which is most
    sensible - to wait patiently. However, if Riose has reached the inner line I trust the wait will not
    be too long."

    And Devers put down his fork. "Wait, is it?" he snarled, glowering. "That's all right for you.
    You've got nothing at stake."

    "Haven't I?" Barr smiled thinly.

    "No. In fact, I'll tell you." Devers' irritation skimmed the surface. "I'm tired of looking at this whole
    business as if it were an interesting something-or-other on a microscope slide. I've got friends
    somewhere out there, dying; and a whole world out there, my home, dying also. You're an
    outsider. You don't know."

    "I have seen friends die." The old man's hands were limp in his lap and his eyes were closed.
    "Are you married?"

    Devers said, "Traders don't marry."

    "Well, I have two sons and a nephew. They have been warned, but - for reasons - they could
    take no action. Our escape means their death. My daughter and my two grandchildren have, I
    hope, left the planet safety before this, but even excluding them, I have already risked and lost
    more than you."

    Devers was morosely savage. "I know. But that was a matter of choice. You might have played
    ball with Riose. I never asked you to-"



    Barr shook his head. "It was not a matter of choice, Devers. Make your conscience free, I didn't
    risk my sons for you. I co-operated with Riose as long as I dared. But there was the Psychic
    Probe."

    The Siwennian patrician opened his eyes and they were sharp with pain. "Riose came to me
    once; it was over a year ago. He spoke of a cult centering about the magicians, but missed the
    truth. It is not quite a cult. You see, it is forty years now that Siwenna has been gripped in the
    same unbearable vise that threatens your world. Five revolts have been ground out. Then I
    discovered the ancient records of Hari Seldon - and now this 'cult' waits.

    "It waits for the coming of the 'magicians' and for that day it is ready. My sons are leaders of
    those who wait. It is that secret which is in my mind and which the Probe must never touch.

    And so they must die as hostages; for the alternative is their death as rebels and half of
    Siwenna with them. You see, I had no choice! And I am no outsider."

    Devers' eyes fell, and Barr continued softly, "It is on a Foundation victory that Siwenna's hopes
    depend. It is for a Foundation victory that my sons are sacrificed. And Hari Seldon does not
    pre-calculate the inevitable salvation of Siwenna as he does that of the Foundation. I have no
    certainty for my people - only hope."

    "But you are still satisfied to wait. Even with the Imperial Navy at Loris."

    "I would wait, in perfect confidence," said Barr, simply, "if they had landed on the planet,
    Terminus, itself."

    The trader frowned hopelessly. "I don't know. It can't really work like that; not just like magic.
    Psychohistory or not, they're terribly strong, and we're weak. What can Setdon do about it?"

    "There's nothing to do. It's all already done. It's proceeding now. Because you don't hear the
    wheels turning and the gongs beating doesn't mean it's any the less certain."

    "Maybe; but I wish you had cracked Riose's skull for keeps. He's more the enemy than all his
    army."

    "Cracked his skull? With Brodrig his second in command?" Barr's face sharpened with hate. "All
    Siwenna would have been my hostage. Brodrig has proven his worth long since. There exists a
    world which five years ago lost one male in every ten - and simply for failure to meet
    outstanding taxes. This same Brodrig was the tax-collector. No, Riose may live. His
    punishments are mercy in comparison."

    "But six months, six months, in the enemy Base, with nothing to show for it." Devers' strong
    hands clasped each other tautly, so that his knuckles cracked. "Nothing to show for it!"

    "Well, now, wait. You remind me-" Barr fumbled in his pouch. "You might want to count this."
    And he tossed the small sphere of metal on the table.

    Devers snatched it. "What is it?"

    "The message capsule. The one that Riose received just before I jacked him. Does that count
    as something?"



    "I don't know. Depends on what's in it!" Devers sat down and turned it over carefully in his
    hand.


    When Barr stepped from his cold shower and, gratefully, into the mild warm current of the air
    dryer, he found Devers silent and absorbed at the workbench.

    The Siwennian slapped his body with a sharp rhythm and spoke above the punctuating sounds.
    "What are you doing?"

    Devers looked up. Droplets of perspiration glittered in his beard. "I'm going to open this
    capsule."

    "Can you open it without Riose's personal characteristic?" There was mild surprise in the
    Siwennian's voice.

    "If I can't, I'll resign from the Association and never skipper a ship for what's left of my life. I've
    got a three-way electronic analysis of the interior now, and I've got little jiggers that the Empire
    never heard of, especially made for jimmying capsules. I've been a burglar before this, y'know.
    A trader has to be something of everything."

    He bent low over the little sphere, and a small flat instrument probed delicately and sparked
    redly at each fleeting contact.

    He said, "This capsule is a crude job, anyway. These Imperial boys are no shakes at this small
    work. I can see that. Ever see a Foundation capsule? It's half the size and impervious to
    electronic analysis in the first place."

    And then he was rigid, the shoulder muscles beneath his tunic tautening visibly. His tiny probe
    pressed slowly-

    It was noiseless when it came, but Devers; relaxed and sighed. In his hand was the shining
    sphere with its message unrolled like a parchment tongue.

    "It's from Brodrig," he said. Then, with contempt, "The message medium is permanent. In a
    Foundation capsule, the message would be oxidized to gas within the minute."

    But Ducem Barr waved him silent. He read the message quickly.

    FROM: AMMEL BRODRIG, ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY, PRIVY
    SECRETARY OF THE COUNCIL, AND PEER OF THE REALM.

    TO: BEL RIOSE, MILITARY GOVERNOR OF SIWENNA. GENERAL OF THE IMPERIAL
    FORCES, AND PEER OF THE REALM. I GREET YOU.

    PLANET #1 1 20 NO LONGER RESISTS. THE PLANS OF OFFENSE AS OUTLINED
    CONTINUE SMOOTHLY. THE ENEMY WEAKENS VISIBLY AND THE ULTIMATE ENDS IN
    VIEW WILL SURELY BE GAINED.

    Barr raised his head from the almost microscopic print and cried bitterly, "The fool! The
    forsaken blasted fop! That a. message?"



    "Huh?" said Devers. He was vaguely disappointed.

    "It says nothing," ground out Barr. "Our lick-spittle courtier is playing at general now. With Riose
    away, he is the field commander and must sooth his paltry spirit by spewing out his pompous
    reports concerning military affairs he has nothing to do with. 'So-and-so planet no longer
    resists.' 'The offensive moves on.' 'The enemy weakens.' The vacuum-headed peacock."

    "Well, now, wait a minute. Hold on-"

    "Throw it away." The old man turned away in mortification. "The Galaxy knows I never expected
    it to be world-shakingly important, but in wartime it is reasonable to assume that even the most
    routine order left undelivered might hamper military movements and lead to complications later.
    It's why I snatched it. But this! Better to have left it. It would have wasted a minute of Riose's
    time that will now be put to more constructive use."

    But Devers had arisen. "Will you hold on and stop throwing your weight around? For Seldon's
    sake-"

    He held out the sliver of message before Barr's nose, "Now read that again. What does he
    mean by 'ultimate ends in view'?"

    "The conquest of the Foundation. Well?"

    "Yes? And maybe he means the conquest of the Empire. You know he believes that to be the
    ultimate end."

    "And if he does?"

    "If he does!" Devers' one-sided smile was lost in his beard. "Why, watch then, and I'll show
    you."

    With one finger the lavishly monogrammed sheet of message-parchment was thrust back into
    its slot. With a soft twang, it disappeared and the globe was a smooth, unbroken whole again.
    Somewhere inside was the tiny oiled whir of the controls as they lost their setting by random
    movements.

    "Now there is no known way of opening this capsule without knowledge of Riose's personal
    characteristic, is there?"

    "To the Empire, no," said Barr.

    "Then the evidence it contains is unknown to us and absolutely authentic."

    "To the Empire, yes," said Barr.

    "And the Emperor can open it, can't he? Personal Characteristics of Government officials must
    be on file. We keep records of OL/r officials at the Foundation."

    "At the Imperial capital as well," agreed Barr.

    "Then when you, a Siwennian patrician and Peer of the Realm, tell this Cleon, this Emperor,
    that his favorite tame-parrot and his shiniest general are getting together to knock him over,



    and hand him the capsule as evidence, what will he think Brodrig's 'ultimate ends' are?"

    Barr sat down weakly. "Wait, I don't follow you." He stroked one thin cheek, and said, "You're
    not really serious, are you?"

    "I am." Devers was angrily excited. "Listen, nine out of the last ten Emperors got their throats
    cut, or their gizzards blasted out by one or another of their generals with bigtime notions in their
    heads. You told me that yourself more than once. Old man Emperor would believe us so fast it
    would make Riose's head swim."

    Barr muttered feebly, "He is serious, For the Galaxy's sake, man, you can't beat a Seldon crisis
    by a far-fetched, impractical, storybook scheme like that. Suppose you had never got hold of
    the capsule. Suppose Brodrig hadn't used the word 'ultimate.' Seldon doesn't depend on wild
    luck."

    "If wild luck comes our way, there's no law says Seldon can't take advantage of it."

    "Certainly. But ... but," Barr stopped, then spoke calmly but with visible restraint. "Look, in the
    first place, how will you get to the planet Trantor? You don't know its location in space, and I
    certainly don't remember the co-ordinates, to say nothing of the ephemerae. You don't even
    know your own position in space."

    "You can't get lost in space," grinned Devers. He was at the controls already. "Down we go to
    the nearest planet, and back we come with complete bearings and the best navigation charts
    Brodrig's hundred thousand smackers can buy."

    "And a blaster in our belly. Our descriptions are probably in every planet in this quarter of the
    Empire."

    "Doc," said Devers, patiently, "don't be a hick tom the sticks. Riose said my ship surrendered
    too easily and, brother, he wasn't kidding. This ship has enough fire-power and enough juice in
    its shield to hold off anything we're Rely to meet this deep inside the frontier. And we have
    personal shields, too. The Empire boys never found them, you know, but they weren't meant to
    be found."

    "All fight," said Barr, "all right. Suppose yourself on Trantor. How do you see the Emperor then?
    You think he keeps office hours?"

    "Suppose we worry about that on Trantor," said Devers.

    And Barr muttered helplessly, "All right again. I've wanted to see Trantor before I die for half a
    century now. Have your way."

    The hypernuclear motor was cut in. The lights flickered and there was the slight internal wrench
    that marked the shift into hyperspace.



    9. ON TRANTOR

    The stars were as thick as weeds in an unkempt field, and for the first time, Lathan Devers
    found the figures to the right of the decimal point of prime importance in calculating the cuts
    through the hyper-regions. There was a claustrophobic sensation about the necessity for leaps
    of not more than a light-year. There was a frightening harshness about a sky which glittered
    unbrokenly in every direction. It was being lost in a sea of radiation.

    And in the center of an open cluster of ten thousand stars, whose light tore to shreds the feebly
    encircling darkness, there circled the huge Imperial planet, Trantor.

    But it was more than a planet; it was the living pulse beat of an Empire of twenty million stellar
    systems. It had only one, function, administration; one purpose, government; and one
    manufactured product, law.

    The entire world was one functional distortion. There was no living object on its surface hut
    man, his pets, and his parasites. No blade of grass or fragment of uncovered soil could be
    found outside the hundred square miles of the Imperial Palace. No fresh water outside the
    Palace grounds existed but in the vast underground cisterns that held the water supply of a
    world.

    The lustrous, indestructible, incorruptible metal that was the unbroken surface of the planet was
    the foundation of the huge, metal structures that mazed the planet. They were structures
    connected by causeways; laced by corridors; cubbyholed by offices; basemented by the huge
    retail centers that covered square miles; penthoused by the glittering amusement world that
    sparkled into life each night.

    One could walk around the world of Trantor and never leave that one conglomerate building,
    nor see the city.

    A fleet of ships greater in number than all the war fleets the Empire had ever supported landed
    their cargoes on Trantor each day to feed the forty billions of humans who gave nothing in
    exchange but the fulfillment of the necessity of untangling the myriads of threads that spiraled
    into the central administration of the most complex government Humanity had ever known.

    Twenty agricultural worlds were the granary of Trantor. A universe was its servant.

    Tightly held by the huge metal arms on either side, the trade ship was gently lowered down the
    huge ramp that led to the hangar. Already Devers had fumed his way through the manifold
    complications of a world conceived in paper work and dedicated to the principle of the
    form-in-quadruplicate.

    There had been the preliminary halt in space, where the first of what had grown into a hundred
    questionnaires had been filled out. There were the hundred cross-examinations, the routine
    administration of a simple Probe, the photographing of the ship, the Characteristic-Analysis of
    the two men, and the subsequent recording of the same, the search for contraband, the
    payment of the entry tax - and finally the question of the identity cards and visitor's visa.

    Ducem Barr was a Siwennian and subject of the Emperor, but Lathan Devers was an unknown



    without the requisite documents. The official in charge at the moment was devastated with
    sorrow, but Devers could not enter. In fact, he would have to be held for official investigation.

    From somewhere a hundred credits in crisp, new bills backed by the estates of Lord Brodrig
    made their appearance, and changed bands quietly. The official hemmed importantly and the
    devastation of his sorrow was assuaged. A new form made its appearance from the appropriate
    pigeonhole. It was filled out rapidly and efficiently, with the Devers characteristic thereto
    formally and properly attached.

    The two men, trader and patrician, entered Siwenna.

    In the hangar, the trade ship was another vessel to be cached, photographed, recorded,
    contents noted, identity cards of passengers facsimiled, and for which a suitable fee was paid,
    recorded, and receipted.

    And then Devers was on a huge terrace under the bright white sun, along which women
    chattered, children shrieked, and men sipped drinks languidly and listened to the huge
    televisors blaring out the news of the Empire.

    Barr paid a requisite number of iridium coins and appropriated the uppermost member of a pile
    of newspapers. It was the Trantor Imperial News, official organ of the government. In the back
    of the news room, there was the soft clicking noise of additional editions being printed in
    long-distance sympathy with the busy machines at the Imperial News offices ten thousand
    miles away by corridor - six thousand by air-machine - just as ten million sets of copies were
    being likewise printed at that moment in ten million other news rooms all over the planet.

    Barr glanced at the headlines and said softly, "What shall we do first?"

    Devers tried to shake himself out of his depression. He was in a universe far removed from his
    own, on a world that weighted him down with its intricacy, among people whose doings were
    incomprehensible and whose language was nearly so. The gleaming metallic towers that
    surrounded him and continued onwards in never-ending multiplicity to beyond the horizon
    oppressed him; the whole busy, unheeding life of a world-metropolis cast him into the horrible
    gloom of isolation and pygmyish unimportance.

    He said, "I better leave it to you, doc."

    Barr was calm, low-voice. "I tried to tell you, but it's hard to believe without seeing for yourself, I
    know that. Do you know how many people want to see the Emperor every day? About one
    million. Do you know how many he sees? About ten. We'll have to work through the civil
    service, and that makes it harder. But we can't afford the aristocracy."

    "We have almost one hundred thousand."

    "A single Peer of the Realm would cost us that, and it would take at least three or four to form
    an adequate bridge to the Emperor. It may take fifty chief commissioners and senior
    supervisors to do the same, but they would cost us only a hundred apiece perhaps. I'll do the
    talking. In the first place, they wouldn't understand your accent, and in the second, you don't
    know the etiquette of Imperial bribery. It's an art, I assure you. Ah!"



    The third page of the Imperial News had what he wanted and he passed the paper to Devers.

    Devers read slowly. The vocabulary was strange, but he understood. He looked up, and his
    eyes were dark with concern. He slapped the news sheet angrily with the back of his hand.

    "You think this can be trusted?"

    "Within limits," replied Barr, calmly. "It's highly improbable that the Foundation fleet was wiped
    out. They've probably reported that several times already, if they've gone by the usual
    war-reporting technique of a world capital far from the actual scene of fighting. What it means,
    though, is that Riose has won another battle, which would be none-too-unexpected. It says he's
    captured Loris. Is that the capital planet of the Kingdom of Loris?"

    "Yes," brooded Devers, "or of what used to be the Kingdom of Loris. And it's not twenty parsecs
    from the Foundation. Doc, we've got to work fast."

    Barr shrugged, "You can't go fast on Trantor. If you try, you'll end up at the point of an
    atom-blaster, most likely."

    "How long will it take?"

    "A month, if we're lucky. A month, and our hundred thousand credits - if even that will suffice.
    And that is providing the Emperor does not take it into his head in the meantime to travel to the
    Summer Planets, where he sees no petitioners at all."

    "But the Foundation-"

    "-Will take care of itself, as heretofore. Come, there's the question of dinner. I'm hungry. And
    afterwards, the evening is ours and we may as well use it. We shall never see Trantor or any
    world like it again, you know."

    The Home Commissioner of the Outer Provinces spread his pudgy hands helplessly and
    peered at the petitioners with owlish nearsightedness. "But the Emperor is indisposed,
    gentlemen. It is really useless to take the matter to my superior. His Imperial Majesty has seen
    no one in a week."

    "He will see us," said Barr, with an affectation of confidence. "It is but a question of seeing a
    member of the staff of the Privy Secretary."

    "Impossible," said the commissioner emphatically. "It would be the worth of my job to attempt
    that. Now if you could but be more explicit concerning the nature of your business. I'm willing to
    help you, understand, but naturally I want something less vague, something I can present to my
    superior as reason for taking the matter further."

    "If my business were such that it could be told to any but the highest," suggested Barr,
    smoothly, "it would scarcely be important enough to rate audience with His Imperial Majesty. I
    propose that you take a chance. I might remind you that if His Imperial Majesty attaches the
    importance to our business which we guarantee that he will, you will stand certain to receive
    the honors you will deserve for helping us now."

    "Yes, but-" and the commissioner shrugged, wordlessly.



    "It's a chance," agreed Barr. "Naturally, a risk should have its compensation. It is a rather great
    favor to ask you, but we have already been greatly obliged with your kindness in offering us this
    opportunity to explain our problem. But if you would allow us to express our gratitude just
    slightly by-"

    Devers scowled. He had heard this speech with its slight variations twenty times in the past
    month. It ended, as always, in a quick shift of the half-hidden bills. But the epilogue differed
    here. Usually the bills vanished immediately; here they remained in plain view, while slowly the
    commissioner counted them, inspecting them front and back as he did so.

    There was a subtle change in his voice. "Backed by the Privy Secretary, hey? Good money!"

    "To get back to the subject-" urged Barr.

    "No, but wait," interrupted the commissioner, "let us go back by easy stages. I really do wish to
    know what your business can be. This money, it is fresh and new, and you must have a good
    deal, for it strikes me that you have seen other officials before me. Come, now, what about it?"

    Barr said, "I don't see what you are driving at."

    "Why, see here, it might be proven that you are upon the planet illegally, since the Identification
    and Entry Cards of your silent friend are certainly inadequate. He is not a subject of the
    Emperor."

    "I deny that."

    "It doesn't matter that you do," said the commissioner, with sudden bluntness. "The official who
    signed his Cards for the sum of a hundred credits has confessed - under pressure - and we
    know more of you than you think."

    "If you are hinting, sir, that the sum we have asked you to accept is inadequate in view of the
    risks-"

    The commissioner smiled. "On the contrary, it is more than adequate." He tossed the bills
    aside. "To return to what I was saying, it is the Emperor himself who has become interested in
    your case. Is it not true, sirs, that you have recently been guests of General Riose? Is it not true
    that you have escaped from the midst of his army with, to put it mildly, astonishing ease? Is it
    not true that you possess a small fortune in bills backed by Lord Brodrig's estates? In short, is it
    not true that you are a pair of spies and assassins sent here to - Well, you shall tell us yourself
    who paid you and for what!"

    "Do you know," said Barr, with silky anger, "I deny the right of a petty commissioner to accuse
    us of crimes. We will leave."

    "You will not leave." The commissioner arose, and his eyes no longer seemed near-sighted.
    "You need answer no question now; that will be reserved for a later - and more forceful - time.
    Nor am I a commissioner; I am a Lieutenant of the Imperial Police. You are under arrest."

    There was a glitteringly efficient blast-gun in his fist as he smiled. "There are greater men than
    you under arrest this day. It is a hornet's nest we are cleaning up."



    Devers snarled and reached slowly for his own gun. The lieutenant of police smiled more
    broadly and squeezed the contacts. The blasting line of force struck Devers' chest in an
    accurate blaze of destruction - that bounced harmlessly off his personal shield in sparkling
    spicules of light.

    Devers shot in turn, and the lieutenant's head fell from off an upper torso that had disappeared.
    It was still smiling as it lay in the jag of sunshine which entered through the new-made hole in
    the wall.

    It was through the back entrance that they left.

    Devers said huskily, "Quickly to the ship. They'll have the alarm out in no time." He cursed in a
    ferocious whisper. "It's another plan that's backfired. I could swear the space fiend himself is
    against me."

    It was in the open that they became aware of the jabbering crowds that surrounded the huge
    televisors. They had no time to wait; the disconnected roaring words that reached them, they
    disregarded. But Barr snatched a copy of the Imperial News before diving into the huge barn of
    the hangar, where the ship lifted hastily through a giant cavity burnt fiercely into the roof.

    "Can you get away from them?" asked Barr.

    Ten ships of the traffic-police wildly followed the runaway craft that had burst out of the lawful,
    radio-beamed Path of Leaving, and then broken every speed law in creation. Further behind
    still, sleek vessels of the Secret Service were lifting in pursuit of a carefully described ship
    manned by two thoroughly identified murderers.

    "Watch me," said Devers, and savagely shifted into hyperspace two thousand miles above the
    surface of Trantor. The shift, so near a planetary mass, meant unconsciousness for Barr and a
    fearful haze of pain for Devers, but light-years further, space above them was clear.

    Devers' somber pride in his ship burst to the surface. He said, "There's not an Imperial ship that
    could follow me anywhere."

    And then, bitterly, "But there is nowhere left to run to for us, and we can't fight their weight.
    What's there to do? What can anyone do?"

    Barr moved feebly on his cot. The effect of the hypershift had not yet worn off, and each of his
    muscles ached. He said, "No one has to do anything. It's all over. Here!"

    He passed the copy of the Imperial News that he still clutched, and the headlines were enough
    for the trader.

    "Recalled and arrested - Riose and Brodrig," Devers muttered. He stared blankly at Barr.
    "Why?"

    "The story doesn't say, but what does it matter? The war with the Foundation is over, and at
    this moment, Siwenna is revolting. Read the story and see." His voice was drifting off. "We'll
    stop in some of the provinces and find out the later details. If you don't mind, I'll go to sleep
    now."



    And he did.


    In grasshopper jumps of increasing magnitude, the trade ship was spanning the Galaxy in its
    return to the Foundation.


    10. THE WAR ENDS

    Lathan Devers felt definitely uncomfortable, and vaguely resentful. He had received his own
    decoration and withstood with mute stoicism the turgid oratory of the mayor which
    accompanied the slip of crimson ribbon. That had ended his share of the ceremonies, but,
    naturally, formality forced him to remain. And it was formality, chiefly - the type that couldn't
    allow him to yawn noisily or to swing a foot comfortably onto a chair seat - that made him long
    to be in space, where he belonged.

    The Siwennese delegation, with Ducem Barr a lionized member, signed the Convention, and
    Siwenna became the first province to pass directly from the Empire's political rule to the
    Foundation's economic one.

    Five Imperial Ships of the Line - captured when Siwenna rebelled behind the lines of the
    Empire's Border Fleet - flashed overhead, huge and massive, detonating a roaring salute as
    they passed over the city.

    Nothing but drinking, etiquette, and small talk now.

    A voice called him. It was Forell; the man who, Devers realized coldly, could buy twenty of him
    with a morning's profits - but a Forell who now crooked a finger at him with genial
    condescension.

    He stepped out upon the balcony into the cool night wind, and bowed properly, while scowling
    into his bristling beard. Barr was there, too; smiling. He said, "Devers, you'll have to come to my
    rescue. I'm being accused of modesty, a horrible and thoroughly unnatural crime."

    "Devers," Forell removed the fat cigar from the side of his mouth when he spoke, "Lord Barr
    claims that your trip to Cleon's capital had nothing to do with the recall of Riose."

    "Nothing at all, sir." Devers was curt. "We never saw the Emperor. The reports we picked up on
    our way back concerning the trial, showed it up to be the purest frameup. There was a mess of
    rigmarole about the general being tied up with subversive interests at the court."

    "And he was innocent?"

    "Riose?" interposed Barr. "Yes! By the Galaxy, yes. Brodrig was a traitor on general principles
    but was never guilty of the specific accusations brought against him. It was a judicial farce; but
    a necessary one, a predictable one, an inevitable one."

    "By psychohistorical necessity, I presume." Forell rolled the phrase sonorously with the
    humorous ease of long familiarity.

    "Exactly." Barr grew serious. "It never penetrated earlier, but once it was over and I could ...



    well ... look at the answers in the back of the book, the problem became simple. We can see,
    now , that the social background of the Empire makes wars of conquest impossible for it. Under
    weak Emperors, it is tom apart by generals competing for a worthless and surely death-bringing
    throne. Under strong Emperors, the Empire is frozen into a paralytic rigor in which
    disintegration apparently ceases for the moment, but only at the sacrifice of all possible
    growth."

    Forell growled bluntly through strong puffs, "You're not clear, Lord Barr."

    Barr smiled slowly. "I suppose so. It's the difficulty of not being trained in psychohistory. Words
    are a pretty fuzzy substitute for mathematical equations. But let's see now-"

    Barr considered, while Forell relaxed, back to railing, and Devers looked into the velvet sky and
    thought wonderingly of Trantor.

    Then Barr said, "You see, sir, you - and Devers - and everyone no doubt, had the idea that
    beating the Empire meant first prying apart the Emperor and his general. You, and Devers, and
    everyone else were right - right all the time, as far as the principle of internal disunion was
    concerned.

    "You were wrong, however, in thinking that this internal split was something to be brought about
    by individual acts, by inspirations of the moment. You tried bribery and lies. You appealed to
    ambition and to fear. But you got nothing for all your pains. In fact, appearances were worse
    after each attempt.

    "And through all this wild threshing up of tiny ripples, the Seldon tidal wave continued onward,
    quietly - but quite irresistibly."

    Ducem Barr turned away, and looked over the railing at the lights of a rejoicing city. Fie said,
    "There was a dead hand pushing all of us; the mighty general and the great Emperor; my world
    and your world - the dead hand of Hari Seldon. Fie knew that a man like Riose would have to
    fail, since it was his success that brought failure; and the greater the success, the surer the
    failure."

    Forell said dryly, "I can't say you're getting clearer."

    "A moment," continued Barr earnestly. "Look at the situation. A weak general could never have
    endangered us, obviously. A strong general during the time of a weak Emperor would never
    have endangered us, either; for he would have turned his arms towards a much more fruitful
    target. Events have shown that three-fourths of the Emperors of the last two centuries were
    rebel generals and rebel viceroys before they were Emperors.

    "So it is only the combination of strong Emperor and strong general that can harm the
    Foundation; for a strong Emperor can not be dethroned easily, and a strong general is forced to
    turn outwards, past the frontiers.

    "But, what keeps the Emperor strong? What kept Cleon strong? It's obvious. Fie is strong,
    because he permits no strong subjects. A courtier who becomes too rich, or a general who
    becomes too popular is dangerous. All the recent history of the Empire proves that to any
    Emperor intelligent enough to be strong.



    "Riose won victories, so the Emperor grew suspicious. All the atmosphere of the times forced
    him to be suspicious. Did Riose refuse a bribe? Very suspicious; ulterior motives. Did his most
    trusted courtier suddenly favor Riose? Very suspicious; ulterior motives. It wasn't the individual
    acts that were suspicious. Anything else would have done which is why our individual plots
    were unnecessary and rather futile. It was the success of Riose that was suspicious. So he was
    recalled, and accused, condemned, murdered. The Foundation wins again.

    "Look, there is not a conceivable combination of events that does not result in the Foundation
    winning. It was inevitable; whatever Riose did, whatever we did."

    The Foundation magnate nodded ponderously. "So! But what if the Emperor and the general
    had been the same person. Fley? What then? That's a case you didn't cover, so you haven't
    proved your point yet."

    Barr shrugged. "I can't prove anything; I haven't the mathematics. But I appeal to your reason.
    With an Empire in which every aristocrat, every strong man, every pirate can aspire to the
    Throne - and, as history shows, often successfully - what would happen to even a strong
    Emperor who preoccupied himself with foreign wars at the extreme end of the Galaxy? How
    long would he have to remain away from the capital before somebody raised the standards of
    civil war and forced him home. The social environment of the Empire would make that time
    short.

    "I once told Riose that not all the Empire's strength could swerve the dead hand of Hari
    Seldom"

    "Good! Good!" Forell was expansively pleased. "Then you imply the Empire can never threaten
    us again."

    "It seems to me so," agreed Barr. "Frankly, Cleon may not live out the year, and there's going to
    be a disputed succession almost as a matter of course, which might mean the last civil war for
    the Empire."

    "Then," said Forell, "there are no more enemies."

    Barr was thoughtful. "There's a Second Foundation."

    "At the other end of the Galaxy? Not for centuries."

    Devers turned suddenly at this, and his face was dark as he faced Forell. "There are internal
    enemies, perhaps."

    "Are there?" asked Forell, coolly. "Who, for instance?"

    "People, for instance, who might like to spread the wealth a bit, and keep it from concentrating
    too much out of the hands that work for it. See what I mean?"


    Slowly, Forell's gaze lost its contempt and grew one with the anger of Devers' own.



    PART II
    THE MULE

    11. BRIDE AND GROOM

    THE MULE Less is known of "The Mule" than of any character of comparable significance to
    Galactic history. Even the period of his greatest renown is known to us chiefly through the eyes
    of his antagonists and, principally, through those of a young bride....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Bayta's first sight of Haven was entirely the contrary of spectacular. Her husband pointed it out
    - a dull star lost in the emptiness of the Galaxy's edge. It was past the last sparse clusters, to
    where straggling points of light gleamed lonely. And even among these it was poor and
    inconspicuous.

    Toran was quite aware that as the earliest prelude to married life, the Red Dwarf lacked
    impressiveness and his lips curled self-consciously. "I know, Bay - It isn't exactly a proper
    change, is it? I mean from the Foundation to this."

    "A horrible change, Toran. I should never have married you."

    And when his face looked momentarily hurt, before he caught himself, she said with her special
    "cozy" tone, "All right, silly. Now let your lower lip droop and give me that special dying-duck
    look - the one just before you're supposed to bury your head on my shoulder, while I stroke
    your hair full of static electricity. You were fishing for some drivel, weren't you? You were
    expecting me to say 'I'd be happy anywhere with you, Toran!' or 'The interstellar depths
    themselves would be home, my sweet, were you but with me!' Now you admit it."

    She pointed a finger at him and snatched it away an instant before his teeth closed upon it.

    He said, "If I surrender, and admit you're right, will you prepare dinner?"

    She nodded contentedly. He smiled, and just looked at her.

    She wasn't beautiful on the grand scale to others - he admitted that - even if everybody did
    look twice. Her hair was dark and glossy, though straight, her mouth a bit wide - but her
    meticulous, close-textured eyebrows separated a white, unlined forehead from the warmest
    mahogany eyes ever filled with smiles.

    And behind a very sturdily-built and staunchly-defended facade of practical, unromantic,
    hard-headedness towards life, there was just that little pool of softness that would never show if
    you poked for it, but could be reached if you knew just how - and never let on that you were
    looking for it.

    Toran adjusted the controls unnecessarily and decided to relax. He was one interstellar jump,



    and then several milli-microparsecs "on the straight" before manipulation by hand was
    necessary. He leaned over backwards to look into the storeroom, where Bayta was juggling
    appropriate containers.

    There was quite a bit of smugness about his attitude towards Bayta - the satisfied awe that
    marks the triumph of someone who has been hovering at the edge of an inferiority complex for
    three years.

    After all he was a provincial - and not merely a provincial, but the son of a renegade Trader.
    And she was of the Foundation itself - and not merely that, but she could trace her ancestry
    back to Mallow.

    And with all that, a tiny quiver underneath. To take her back to Haven, with its rock-world and
    cave-cities was bad enough. To have her face the traditional hostility of Trader for Foundation -
    nomad for city dweller - was worse.

    Still - After supper, the last jump!

    Haven was an angry crimson blaze, and the second planet was a ruddy patch of light with
    atmosphere-blurred rim and a half-sphere of darkness. Bayta leaned over the large view table
    with its spidering of crisscross lines that centered Haven II neatly.

    She said gravely, "I wish I had met your father first. If he takes a dislike to me-"

    "Then," said Toran matter-of-factly, "you would be the first pretty girl to inspire that in him.
    Before he lost his arm and stopped roving around the Galaxy, he - Well, if you ask him about it,
    he'll talk to you about it till your ears wear down to a nubbin. After a while I got to thinking that
    he was embroidering; because he never told the same story twice the same way-"

    Haven II was rushing up at them now. The landlocked sea wheeled ponderously below them,
    slate-gray in the lowering dimness and lost to sight, here and there, among the wispy clouds.
    Mountains jutted raggedly along the coast.

    The sea became wrinkled with nearness and, as it veered off past the horizon just at the end,
    there was one vanishing glimpse of shore-hugging ice fields.

    Toran grunted under the fierce deceleration, "Is your suit locked?"

    Bayta's plump face was round and ruddy in the incasing sponge-foam of the internally-heated,
    skin-clinging costume.

    The ship lowered crunchingly on the open field just short of the lifting of the plateau.

    They climbed out awkwardly into the solid darkness of the outer-galactic night, and Bayta
    gasped as the sudden cold bit, and the thin wind swirled emptily. Toran seized her elbow and
    nudged her into an awkward run over the smooth, packed ground towards the sparking of
    artificial light in the distance.

    The advancing guards met them halfway, and after a whispered exchange of words, they were
    taken onward. The wind and the cold disappeared when the gate of rock opened and then
    closed behind them. The warm interior, white with wall-light, was filled with an incongruous



    humming bustle. Men looked up from their desks, and Toran produced documents.

    They were waved onward after a short glance and Toran whispered to his wife, "Dad must have
    fixed up the preliminaries. The usual lapse here is about five hours."

    They burst into the open and Bayta said suddenly, "Oh, my-"

    The cave city was in daylight - the white daylight of a young sun. Not that there was a sun, of
    course. What should have been the sky was lost in the unfocused glow of an over-all brilliance.
    And the warm air was properly thick and fragrant with greenery.

    Bayta said, "Why, Toran, it's beautiful."

    Toran grinned with anxious delight. "Well, now, Bay, it isn't like anything on the Foundation, of
    course, but it's the biggest city on Haven II - twenty thousand people, you know - and you'll get
    to like it. No amusement palaces, I'm afraid, but no secret police either."

    "Oh, Torie, it's just like a toy city. It's all white and pink - and so clean."

    "Well-" Toran looked at the city with her. The houses were two stories high for the most part,
    and of the smooth vein rock indigenous to the region. The spires of the Foundation were
    missing, and the colossal community houses of the Old Kingdoms - but the smallness was
    there and the individuality; a relic of personal initiative in a Galaxy of mass life.

    He snapped to sudden attention. "Bay - There's Dad! Right there - where I'm pointing, silly.
    Don't you see him?"

    She did. It was just the impression of a large man, waving frantically, fingers spread wide as
    though groping wildly in air. The deep thunder of a drawn-out shout reached them. Bayta trailed
    her husband, rushing downwards over the close-cropped lawn. She caught sight of a smaller
    man, white-haired, almost lost to view behind the robust One-arm, who still waved and still
    shouted.

    Toran cried over his shoulder, "It's my father's half-brother. The one who's been to the
    Foundation. You know."

    They met in the grass, laughing and incoherent, and Toran's father let out a final whoop for
    sheer joy. He hitched at his short jacket and adjusted the metal-chased belt that was his one
    concession to luxury.

    His eyes shifted from one of the youngsters to the other, and then he said, a little out of breath,
    "You picked a rotten day to return home, boy!"

    "What? Oh, it is Seldon's birthday, isn't it?"

    "It is. I had to rent a car to make the trip here, and dragoon Randu to drive it. Not a public
    vehicle to be had at gun's point."

    His eyes were on Bayta now, and didn't leave. He spoke to her more softly, "I have the crystal
    of you right here - and it's good, but I can see the fellow who took it was an amateur."



    He had the small cube of transparency out of his jacket pocket and in the light the laughing little
    face within sprang to vivid colored life as a miniature Bayta.

    "That one!" said Bayta. "Now I wonder why Toran should send that caricature. I'm surprised you
    let me come near you, sir."

    "Are you now? Call me Fran. I'll have none of this fancy mess. For that, I think you can take my
    arm, and we'll go on to the car. Till now I never did think my boy knew what he was ever up to. I
    think I'll change that opinion. I think I'll have to change that opinion."

    Toran said to his half uncle softly, "How is the old man these days? Does he still hound the
    women?"

    Randu puckered up all over his face when he smiled. "When he can, Toran, when he can.

    There are times when he remembers that his next birthday will be his sixtieth, and that
    disheartens him. But he shouts it down, this evil thought, and then he is himself. He is a Trader
    of the ancient type. But you, Toran. Where did you find such a pretty wife?"

    The young man chuckled and linked arms. "Do you want a three years' history at a gasp,
    uncle?"

    It was in the small living room of the home that Bayta struggled out of her traveling cloak and
    hood and shook her hair loose. She sat down, crossing her knees, and returned the
    appreciative stare of this large, ruddy man.

    She said, "I know what you're trying to estimate, and I'll help you; Age, twenty-four, height,
    five-four, weight, one-ten, educational specialty, history." She noticed that he always crooked
    his stand so as to hide the missing arm. But now Fran leaned close and said, "Since you
    mention it -weight, one-twenty."

    He laughed loudly at her flush. Then he said to the company in general, "You can always tell a
    woman's weight by her upper arm - with due experience, of course. Do you want a drink, Bay?"

    "Among other things," she said, and they left together, while Toran busied himself at the book
    shelves to check for new additions.

    Fran returned alone and said, "She'll be down later."

    He lowered himself heavily into the large comer chair and placed his stiff-jointed left leg on the
    stool before it. The laughter had left his red face, and Toran turned to face him.

    Fran said, "Well, you're home, boy, and I'm glad you are. I like your woman. She's no whining
    ninny."

    "I married her," said Toran simply.

    "Well, that's another thing altogether, boy." His eyes darkened. "It's a foolish way to tie up the
    future. In my longer life, and more experienced, I never did such a thing."

    Randu interrupted from the comer where he stood quietly. "Now Franssart, what comparisons
    are you making? Till your crash landing six years ago you were never in one spot long enough



    to establish residence requirements for marriage, And since then, who would have you?"

    The one-armed man jerked erect in his seat and replied hotly, "Many, you snowy dotard-"

    Toran said with hasty tact, "It's largely a legal formality, Dad. The situation has its
    conveniences."

    "Mostly for the woman," grumbled Fran.

    "And even if so," agreed Randu, "it's up to the boy to decide. Marriage is an old custom among
    the Foundationers."

    "The Foundationers are not fit models for an honest Trader," smoldered Fran.

    Toran broke in again, "My wife is a Foundationer." Fie looked from one to the other, and then
    said quietly, "She's coming."

    The conversation took a general turn after the evening meal, which Fran had spiced with three
    tales of reminiscence composed of equal parts of blood, women, profits, and embroidery. The
    small televisor was on, and some classic drama was playing itself out in an unregarded
    whisper. Randu had hitched himself into a more comfortable position on the low couch and
    gazed past the slow smoke of his long pipe to where Bayta had knelt down upon the softness
    of the white fur mat brought back once long ago from a trade mission and now spread out only
    upon the most ceremonious occasions.

    "You have studied history, my girl?" he asked, pleasantly.

    Bayta nodded. "I was the despair of my teachers, but I learned a bit, eventually."

    "A citation for scholarship," put in Toran, smugly, "that's all!"

    "And what did you learn?" proceeded Randu, smoothly.

    "Everything? Now?" laughed the girl.

    The old man smiled gently. "Well then, what do you think of the Galactic situation?"

    "I think," said Bayta, concisely, "that a Seldon crisis is pending - and that if it isn't then away
    with the Seldon plan altogether. It is a failure."

    ("Whew," muttered Fran, from his comer. "What a way to speak of Seldon." But he said nothing
    aloud.)

    Randu sucked at his pipe speculatively. "Indeed? Why do you say that? I was to the
    Foundation, you know, in my younger days, and I, too, once thought great dramatic thoughts.
    But, now, why do you say that?"

    "Well," Bayta's eyes misted with thought as she curled her bare toes into the white softness of
    the rug and nestled her little chin in one plump hand, "it seems to me that the whole essence of
    Seldon's plan was to create a world better than the ancient one of the Galactic Empire. It was
    failing apart, that world, three centuries ago, when Seldon first established the Foundation -
    and if history speaks truly, it was falling apart of the triple disease of inertia, despotism, and



    maldistribution of the goods of the universe."

    Randu nodded slowly, while Toran gazed with proud, luminous eyes at his wife, and Fran in the
    comer clucked his tongue and carefully refilled his glass.

    Bayta said, "If the story of Seldon is true, he foresaw the complete collapse of the Empire
    through his Jaws of psychohistory, and was able to predict the necessary thirty thousand years
    of barbarism before the establishment of a new Second Empire to restore civilization and
    culture to humanity. It was the whole aim of his life-work to set up such conditions as would
    insure a speedier rejuvenation,"

    The deep voice of Fran burst out, "And that's why he established the two Foundations, honor
    be to his name."

    "And that's why he established the two Foundations," assented Bayta. "Our Foundation was a
    gathering of the scientists of the dying Empire intended to carry on the science and learning of
    man to new heights. And the Foundation was so situated in space and the historical
    environment was such that through the careful calculations of his genius, Seldon foresaw that
    in one thousand years, it would become a newer, greater Empire."

    There was a reverent silence.

    The girl said softly, "It's an old story. You all know it. For almost three centuries every human
    being of the Foundation has known it. But I thought it would be appropriate to go through it -
    just quickly. Today is Seldon's birthday, you know, and even if I am of the Foundation, and you
    are of Flaven, we have that in common-"

    She lit a cigarette slowly, and watched the glowing tip absently. "The laws of history are as
    absolute as the laws of physics, and if the probabilities of error are greater, it is only because
    history does not deal with as many humans as physics does atoms, so that individual variations
    count for more. Seldon predicted a series of crises through the thousand years of growth, each
    of which would force a new turning of our history into a pre-calculated path. It is those crises
    which direct us - and therefore a crisis must come now.

    "Now!" she repeated, forcefully. "It's almost a century since the last one, and in that century,
    every vice of the Empire has been repeated in the Foundation. Inertia! Our ruling class knows
    one law; no change. Despotism! They know one rule; force. Maldistribution! They know one
    desire; to hold what is theirs."

    "While others starve!" roared Fran suddenly with a mighty blow of his fist upon the arm of his
    chair. "Girl, your words are pearls. The fat guts on their moneybags ruin the Foundation, while
    the brave Traders hide their poverty on dregs of worlds like Flaven. It's a disgrace to Seldon, a
    casting of dirt in his face, a spewing in his beard." Fie raised his arm high, and then his face
    lengthened. "If I had my other arm! If - once - they had listened to me!"

    "Dad," said Toran, "take it easy."

    "Take it easy. Take it easy," his father mimicked savagely. "We'll live here and die here forever
    - and you say, take it easy."



    "That's our modern Lathan Devers," said Randu, gesturing with his pipe, "this Fran of ours.
    Devers died in the slave mines eighty years ago with your husband's great-grandfather,
    because he lacked wisdom and didn't lack heart-"

    "Yes, by the Galaxy, I'd do the same if I were he," swore Fran. "Devers was the greatest Trader
    in history - greater than the overblown windbag, Mallow, the Foundationers worship. If the
    cutthroats who lord the Foundation killed him because he loved justice, the greater the
    blood-debt owed them."

    "Go on, girl," said Randu. "Go on, or, surely, he'll talk a the night and rave all the next day."

    "There's nothing to go on about," she said, with a sudden gloom. "There must be a crisis, but I
    don't know how to make one. The progressive forces on the Foundation are oppressed
    fearfully. You Traders may have the will, but you are hunted and disunited. If all the forces of
    good will in and out of the Foundation could combine-"

    Fran's laugh was a raucous jeer. "Listen to her, Randu, listen to her. In and out of the
    Foundation, she says. Girl, girl, there's no hope in the flab-sides of the Foundation. Among
    them some hold the whip and the rest are whipped dead whipped. Not enough spunk left in the
    whole rotten world to outface one good Trader."

    Bayta's attempted interruptions broke feebly against the overwhelming wind.

    Toran leaned over and put a hand over her mouth. "Dad," he said, coldly, "you've never been
    on the Foundation. You know nothing about it. I tell you that the underground there is brave and
    daring enough. I could tell you that Bayta was one of them-"

    "All right, boy, no offense. Now, where's the cause for anger?" Fie was genuinely perturbed.

    Toran drove on fervently, "The trouble with you, Dad, is that you've got a provincial outlook.

    You think because some hundred thousand Traders scurry into holes on an unwanted planet at
    the end of nowhere, that they're a great people. Of course, any tax collector from the
    Foundation that gets here never leaves again, but that's cheap heroism. What would you do if
    the Foundation sent a fleet?"

    "We'd blast them," said Fran, sharply.

    "And get blasted - with the balance in their favor. You're outnumbered, outarmed, outorganized
    - and as soon as the Foundation thinks it worth its while, you'll realize that. So you had better
    seek your allies - on the Foundation itself, if you can."

    "Randu, said Fran, looking at his brother like a great, helpless bull.

    Randu took his pipe away from his lips, "The boy's right, Fran. When you listen to the little
    thoughts deep inside you, you know he is. But they're uncomfortable thoughts, so you drown
    them out with that roar of yours. But they're still there. Toran, I'll tell you why I brought all this
    up."

    Fie puffed thoughtfully awhile, then dipped his pipe into the neck of the tray, waited for the silent
    flash, and withdrew it clean. Slowly, he filled it again with precise tamps of his little finger.



    He said, "Your little suggestion of Foundation's interest in us, Toran, is to the point. There have
    been two recent visits lately - for tax purposes. The disturbing point is that the second visitor
    was accompanied by a light patrol ship. They landed in Gleiar City - giving us the miss for a
    change - and they never lifted off again, naturally. But now they'll surely be back. Your father is
    aware of all this, Toran, he really is.

    "Look at the stubborn rakehell. He knows Haven is in trouble, and he knows we're helpless, but
    he repeats his formulas. It warms and protects him. But once he's had his say, and roared his
    defiance, and feels he's discharged his duty as a man and a Bull Trader, why he's as
    reasonable as any of us."

    "Any of who?" asked Bayta.

    He smiled at her. "We've formed a little group, Bayta - just in our city. We haven't done
    anything, yet. We haven't even managed to contact the other cities yet, but it's a start."

    "But towards what?"

    Randu shook his head. "We don't know-yet. We hope for a miracle. We have decided that, as
    you say, a Seldon crisis must be at hand." He gestured widely upwards. "The Galaxy is full of
    the chips and splinters of the broken Empire. The generals swarm. Do you suppose the time
    may come when one will grow bold?"

    Bayta considered, and shook her head decisively, so that the long straight hair with the single
    inward curl at the end swirled about her ears. "No, not a chance. There's not one of those
    generals who doesn't know that an attack on the Foundation is suicide. Bel Riose of the old
    Empire was a better man than any of them, and he attacked with the resources of a galaxy, and
    couldn't win against the Seldon Plan. Is there one general that doesn't know that?"

    "But what if we spur them on?"

    "Into where? Into an atomic furnace? With what could you possibly spur them?"

    "Well, there is one - a new one. In this past year or two, there has come word of a strange man
    whom they call the Mule."

    "The Mule?" She considered. "Ever hear of him, Torie?"

    Toran shook his head. She said, "What about him?"

    "I don't know. But he wins victories at, they say, impossible odds. The rumors may be
    exaggerated, but it would be interesting, in any case, to become acquainted with him. Not every
    man with sufficient ability and sufficient ambition would believe in Hari Seldon and his laws of
    psychohistory. We could encourage that disbelief. He might attack."

    "And the Foundation would win."

    "Yes - but not necessarily easily. It might be a crisis, and we could take advantage of such a
    crisis to force a compromise with the despots of the Foundation. At the worst, they would forget
    us long enough to enable us to plan farther."



    "What do you think, Torie?"

    Toran smiled feebly and pulled at a loose brown curl that fell over one eye. "The way he
    describes it, it can't hurt; but who is the Mule? What do you know of him, Randu?"

    "Nothing yet. For that, we could use you, Toran. And your wife, if she's willing. We've talked of
    this, your father and I. We've talked of this thoroughly."

    "In what way, Randu? What do you want of us?" The young man cast a quick inquisitive look at
    his wife.

    "Have you had a honeymoon?"

    "Well ... yes ... if you can call the trip from the Foundation a honeymoon."

    "How about a better one on Kalgan? It's semitropical beaches - water sports - bird hunting -
    quite the vacation spot. It's about seven thousand parsecs in-not too far."

    "What's on Kalgan?"

    "The Mule! His men, at least. He took it last month, and without a battle, though Kalgan's
    warlord broadcast a threat to blow the planet to ionic dust before giving it up."

    "Where's the warlord now?"

    "He isn't," said Randu, with a shrug. "What do you say?"

    "But what are we to do?"

    "I don't know. Fran and I are old; we're provincial. The Traders of Haven are all essentially
    provincial. Even you say so. Our trading is of a very restricted sort, and we're not the Galaxy
    roamers our ancestors were, Shut up, Fran! But you two know the Galaxy. Bayta, especially,
    speaks with a nice Foundation accent. We merely wish whatever you can find out. If you can
    make contact ... but we wouldn't expect that. Suppose you two think it over. You can meet our
    entire group if you wish ... oh, not before next week. You ought to have some time to catch your
    breath."

    There was a pause and then Fran roared, "Who wants; another drink? I mean, besides me?"


    12. CAPTAIN AND MAYOR

    Captain Han Pritcher was unused to the luxury of his surroundings and by no means
    impressed. As a general thing, he discouraged self-analysis and all forms of philosophy and
    metaphysics not directly connected with his work.

    It helped.

    His work consisted largely of what the War Department called "intelligence," the sophisticates,
    "espionage," and the romanticists, "spy stuff." And, unfortunately, despite the frothy shrillness of
    the televisors, "intelligence," "espionage," and "spy stuff" are at best a sordid business of



    routine betrayal and bad faith. It is excused by society since it is in the "interest of the State,"
    but since philosophy seemed always to lead Captain Pritcher to the conclusion that even in that
    holy interest, society is much more easily soothed than one's own conscience - he discouraged
    philosophy.

    And now, in the luxury of the mayor's anteroom, his thoughts turned inward despite himself.

    Men had been promoted over his head continuously, though of lesser ability - that much was
    admitted. He had withstood an eternal rain of black marks and official reprimands, and survived
    it. And stubbornly he had held to his own way in the firm belief that insubordination in that same
    holy "interest of the State" would yet be recognized for the service it was.

    So here he was in the anteroom of the mayor-with five soldiers as a respectful guard, and
    probably a court-martial awaiting him.

    The heavy, marble doors rolled apart smoothly, silently, revealing satiny walls, a red plastic
    carpeting, and two more marble doors, metal-inlaid, within. Two officials in the straight-lined
    costume of three centuries back, stepped out, and called:

    "An audience to Captain Han Pritcher of Information."

    They stepped back with a ceremonious bow as the captain started forward. His escort stopped
    at the outer door, and he entered the inner alone.

    On the other side of the doors, in a large room strangely simple, behind a large desk strangely
    angular, sat a small man, almost lost in the immensity,

    Mayor Indbur - successively the third of that name - was the grandson of the first Indbur, who
    had been brutal and capable; and who had exhibited the first quality in spectacular fashion by
    his manner of seizing power, and the latter by the skill with which he put an end to the last
    farcical remnants of free election and the even greater skill with which he maintained a
    relatively peaceful rule.

    Mayor Indbur was also the son of the second Indbur, who was the first Mayor of the Foundation
    to succeed to his post by right of birth - and who was only half his father, for he was merely
    brutal.

    So Mayor Indbur was the third of the name and the second to succeed by right of birth, and he
    was the least of the three, for he was neither brutal nor capable - but merely an excellent
    bookkeeper born wrong.

    Indbur the Third was a peculiar combination of ersatz characteristics to all but himself.

    To him, a stilted geometric love of arrangement was "system," an indefatigable and feverish
    interest in the pettiest facets of day-to-day bureaucracy was "industry," indecision when right
    was "caution," and blind stubbornness when wrong, "determination."

    And withal he wasted no money, killed no man needlessly, and meant extremely well.

    If Captain Pritcher's gloomy thoughts ran along these lines as he remained respectfully in place
    before the large desk, the wooden arrangement of his features yielded no insight into the fact.



    He neither coughed, shifted weight, nor shuffled his feet until the thin face of the mayor lifted
    slowly as the busy stylus ceased in its task of marginal notations, and a sheet of close-printed
    paper was lifted from one neat stack and placed upon another neat stack.

    Mayor Indbur clasped his hands carefully before him, deliberately refraining from disturbing the
    careful arrangement of desk accessories.

    He said, in acknowledgment, "Captain Han Pritcher of Information."

    And Captain Pritcher in strict obedience to protocol bent one knee nearly to the ground and
    bowed his head until he heard the words of release.

    "Arise, Captain Pritcher!"

    The mayor said with an air of warm sympathy, "You are here, Captain Pritcher, because of
    certain disciplinary action taken against yourself by your superior officer. The papers
    concerning such action have come, in the ordinary course of events, to my notice, and since no
    event in the Foundation is of disinterest to me, I took the trouble to ask for further information
    on your case. You are not, I hope, surprised."

    Captain Pritcher said unemotionally, "Excellence, no. Your justice is proverbial."

    "Is it? Is it?" His tone was pleased, and the tinted contact lenses he wore caught the light in a
    manner that imparted a hard, dry gleam to his eyes. Meticulously, he fanned out a series of
    metal-bound folders before him. The parchment sheets within crackled sharply as he turned
    them, his long finger following down the line as he spoke.

    "I have your record here, captain - complete. You are forty-three and have been an Officer of
    the Armed Forces for seventeen years. You were born in Loris, of Anacreonian parents, no
    serious childhood diseases, an attack of myo ... well, that's of no importance ... education,
    premilitary, at the Academy of Sciences, major, hyper-engines, academic standing ... hm-m-m,
    very good, you are to be congratulated ... entered the Army as Under-Officer on the one
    hundred second day of the 293rd year of the Foundation Era."

    He lifted his eyes momentarily as he shifted the first folder, and opened the second.

    "You see," he said, "in my administration, nothing is left to chance. Order! System!"

    He lifted a pink, scented jelly-globule to his lips. It was his one vice, and but dolingly indulged
    in. Witness the fact that the mayor's desk lacked that almost-inevitable atom flash for the
    disposal of dead tobacco. For the mayor did not smoke.

    Nor, as a matter of course, did his visitors.

    The mayor's voice droned on, methodically, slurringly, mumblingly - now and then interspersed
    with whispered comments of equally mild and equally ineffectual commendation or reproof.

    Slowly, he replaced the folders as originally, in a single neat pile.

    "Well, captain," he said, briskly, "your record is unusual. Your ability is outstanding, it would
    seem, and your services valuable beyond question. I note that you have been wounded in the



    line of duty twice, and that you have been awarded the Order of Merit for bravery beyond the
    call of duty. Those are facts not lightly to be minimized."

    Captain Pritcher's expressionless face did not soften. He remained stiffly erect. Protocol
    required that a subject honored by an audience with the mayor may not sit down - a point
    perhaps needlessly reinforced by the fact that only one chair existed in the room, the one
    underneath the mayor. Protocol further required no statements other than those needed to
    answer a direct question.

    The mayor's eyes bore down hard upon the soldier and his voice grew pointed and heavy.
    "However, you have not been promoted in ten years, and your superiors report, over and over
    again, of the unbending stubbornness of your character. You are reported to be chronically
    insubordinate, incapable of maintaining a correct attitude towards superior officers, apparently
    uninterested in maintaining frictionless relationships with your colleagues, and an incurable
    troublemaker, besides. How do you explain that, captain?"

    "Excellence, I do what seems right to me. My deeds on behalf of the State, and my wounds in
    that cause bear witness that what seems fight to me is also in the interest of the State."

    "A soldierly statement, captain, but a dangerous doctrine. More of that, later. Specifically, you
    are charged with refusing an assignment three times in the face of orders signed by my legal
    delegates. What have you to say to that?"

    "Excellence, the assignment lacks significance in a critical time, where matters of first
    importance are being ignored."

    "Ah, and who tells you these matters you speak of are of the first importance at all, and if they
    are, who tells you further that they are ignored?"

    "Excellence, these things are quite evident to me. My experience and my knowledge of events
    - the value of neither of which my superiors deny - make it plain."

    "But, my good captain, are you blind that you do not see that by arrogating to yourself the right
    to determine Intelligence policy, you usurp the duties of your superior?"

    "Excellence, my duty is primarily to the State, and not to my superior."

    "Fallacious, for your superior has his superior, and that superior is myself, and I am the State.
    But come, you shall have no cause to complain of this justice of mine that you say is proverbial.
    State in your own words the nature of the breach in discipline that has brought all this on."

    "Excellence, my duty is primarily to the State, and not to my living the life of a retired merchant
    mariner upon the world of Kalgan. My instructions were to direct Foundation activity upon the
    planet, perfect an organization to act as check upon the warlord of Kalgan, particularly as
    regards his foreign policy."

    "This is known to me. Continue!"

    "Excellence, my reports have continually stressed the strategic positions of Kalgan and the
    systems it controls. I have reported on the ambition of the warlord, his resources, his



    determination to extend his domain and his essential friendliness - or, perhaps, neutrality -
    towards the Foundation."

    "I have read your reports thoroughly. Continue!"

    "Excellence, I returned two months ago. At that time, there was no sign of impending war; no
    sign of anything but an almost superfluity of ability to repel any conceivable attack. One month
    ago, an unknown soldier of fortune took Kalgan without a fight. The man who was once warlord
    of Kalgan is apparently no longer alive. Men do not speak of treason - they speak only of the
    power and genius of this strange condottiere - this Mule."

    "This who?" the mayor leaned forward, and looked offended.

    "Excellence, he is known as the Mule. He is spoken of little, in a factual sense, but I have
    gathered the scraps and fragments of knowledge and winnowed out the most probable of them.
    He is apparently a man of neither birth nor standing. His father, unknown. His mother, dead in
    childbirth. His upbringing, that of a vagabond. His education, that of the tramp worlds, and the
    backwash alleys of space. He has no name other than that of the Mule, a name reportedly
    applied by himself to himself, and signifying, by popular explanation, his immense physical
    strength, and stubbornness of purpose."

    "What is his military strength, captain? Never mind his physique."

    "Excellence, men speak of huge fleets, but in this they may be influenced by the strange fall of
    Kalgan. The territory he controls is not large, though its exact limits are not capable of definite
    determination. Nevertheless, this man must be investigated."

    "Hm-m-m. So! So!" The mayor fell into a reverie, and slowly with twenty-four strokes of his
    stylus drew six squares in hexagonal arrangements upon the blank top sheet of a pad, which
    he tore off, folded neatly in three parts and slipped into the wastepaper slot at his right hand. It
    slid towards a clean and silent atomic disintegration.

    "Now then, tell me, captain, what is the alternative? You have told me what 'must' be
    investigated. What have you been ordered to investigate?"

    "Excellence, there is a rat hole in space that, it seems, does not pay its taxes."

    "Ah, and is that all? You are not aware, and have not been told that these men who do not pay
    their taxes, are descendants of the wild Traders of our early days - anarchists, rebels, social
    maniacs who claim Foundation ancestry and deride Foundation culture. You are not aware,
    and have not been told, that this rat hole in space, is not one, but many; that these rat holes are
    in greater number than we know; that these rat holes conspire together, one with the other, and
    all with the criminal elements that still exist throughout Foundation territory. Even here, captain,
    even here!"

    The mayor's momentary fire subsided quickly. "You are not aware, captain?"

    "Excellence, I have been told all this. But as servant of the State, I must serve faithfully - and
    he serves most faithfully who serves Truth. Whatever the political implications of these dregs of
    the ancient Traders - the warlords who have inherited the splinters of the old Empire have the



    power. The Traders have neither arms nor resources. They have not even unity. I am not a tax
    collector to be sent on a child's errand."


    "Captain Pritcher, you are a soldier, and count guns. It is a failing to be allowed you up to the
    point where it involves disobedience to myself. Take care. My justice is not simply weakness.
    Captain, it has already been proven that the generals of the Imperial Age and the warlords of
    the present age are equally impotent against us. Seldon's science which predicts the course of
    the Foundation is based, not on individual heroism, as you seem to believe, but on the social
    and economic trends of history. We have passed successfully through four crises already, have
    we not?"

    "Excellence, we have. Yet Seldon's science is known only to Seldon. We ourselves have but
    faith. In the first three crises, as I have been carefully taught, the Foundation was led by wise
    leaders who foresaw the nature of the crises and took the proper precautions. Otherwise - who
    can say?"

    "Yes, captain, but you omit the fourth crisis. Come, captain, we had no leadership worthy of the
    name then, and we faced the cleverest opponent, the heaviest armor, the strongest force of all.
    Yet we won by the inevitability of history."

    "Excellence, that is true. But this history you mention became inevitable only after we had
    fought desperately for over a year. The inevitable victory we won cost us half a thousand ships
    and half a million men. Excellence, Seldon's plan helps those who help themselves."

    Mayor Indbur frowned and grew suddenly tired of his patient exposition. It occurred to him that
    there was a fallacy in condescension, since it was mistaken for permission to argue eternally; to
    grow contentious; to wallow in dialectic. Fie said, stiffly, "Nevertheless, captain, Seldon
    guarantees victory over the warlords, and I can not, in these busy times, indulge in a dispersal
    of effort. These Traders you dismiss are Foundation-derived. A war with them would be a civil
    war. Seldon's plan makes no guarantee there for us - since they anc/we are Foundation. So
    they must be brought to heel. You have your orders."

    "Excellence-"

    "You have been asked no question, captain. You have your orders. You will obey those orders.
    Further argument of any sort with myself or those representing myself will be considered
    treason. You are excused."

    Captain Flan Pritcher knelt once more, then left with slow, backward steps.

    Mayor Indbur, third of his name, and second mayor of Foundation history to be so by fight of
    birth, recovered his equilibrium, and lifted another sheet of paper from the neat stack at his left.
    It was a report on the saving of funds due to the reduction of the quantity of metal-foam edging
    on the uniforms of the police force. Mayor Indbur crossed out a superfluous comma, corrected
    a misspelling, made three marginal notations, and placed it upon the neat stack at his fight. Fie
    lifted another sheet of paper from the neat stack at his left.

    Captain Flan Pritcher of Information found a Personal Capsule waiting for him when he returned
    to barracks. It contained orders, terse and redly underlined with a stamped "URGENT"' across



    it, and the whole initialed with a precise, capital "I".

    Captain Han Pritcher was ordered to the "rebel world called Haven" in the strongest terms.

    Captain Han Pritcher, alone in his light one-man speedster, set his course quietly and calmly
    for Kalgan. He slept that night the sleep of a successfully stubborn man.


    13. LIEUTENANT AND CLOWN

    If, from a distance of seven thousand parsecs, the fall of Kalgan to the armies of the Mule had
    produced reverberations that had excited the curiosity of an old Trader, the apprehension of a
    dogged captain, and the annoyance of a meticulous mayor - to those on Kalgan itself, it
    produced nothing and excited no one. It is the invariable lesson to humanity that distance in
    time, and in space as well, lends focus. It is not recorded, incidentally, that the lesson has ever
    been permanently learned.

    Kalgan was - Kalgan. It alone of all that quadrant of the Galaxy seemed not to know that the
    Empire had fallen, that the Stannells no longer ruled, that greatness had departed, and peace
    had disappeared.

    Kalgan was the luxury world. With the edifice of mankind crumbling, it maintained its integrity as
    a producer of pleasure, a buyer of gold and a seller of leisure.

    It escaped the harsher vicissitudes of history, for what conqueror would destroy or even
    seriously damage a world so full of the ready cash that would buy immunity.

    Yet even Kalgan had finally become the headquarters of a warlord and its softness had been
    tempered to the exigencies of war.

    Its tamed jungles, its mildly modeled shores, and its garishly glamorous cities echoed to the
    march of imported mercenaries and impressed citizens. The worlds of its province had been
    armed and its money invested in battleships rather than bribes for the first time in its history. Its
    ruler proved beyond doubt that he was determined to defend what was his and eager to seize
    what was others. He was a great one of the Galaxy, a war and peace maker, a builder of
    Empire, an establisher of dynasty.

    And an unknown with a ridiculous nickname had taken him - and his arms - and his budding
    Empire - and had not even fought a battle.

    So Kalgan was as before, and its uniformed citizens hurried back to their older life, while the
    foreign professionals of war merged easily into the newer bands that descended.

    Again as always, there were the elaborate luxury hunts for the cultivated animal life of the
    jungles that never took human life; and the speedster bird-chases in the air above, that was
    fatal only to the Great Birds.

    In the cities, the escapers of the Galaxy could take their varieties of pleasure to suit their purse,
    from the ethereal sky-palaces of spectacle and fantasy that opened their doors to the masses



    at the jingle of half a credit, to the unmarked, unnoted haunts to which only those of great
    wealth were of the cognoscenti.

    To the vast flood, Toran and Bayta added not even a trickle. They registered their ship in the
    huge common hangar on the East Peninsula, and gravitated to that compromise of the
    middle-classes, the Inland Sea-where the pleasures were yet legal, and even respectable, and
    the crowds not yet beyond endurance.

    Bayta wore dark glasses against the light, and a thin, white robe against the heat. Warm-tinted
    arms, scarcely the goldener for the sun, clasped her knees to her, and she stared with firm,
    abstracted gaze at the length of her husband's outstretched body - almost shimmering in the
    brilliance of white sun-splendor.

    "Don't overdo it," she had said at first, but Toran was of a dying-red star, Despite three years of
    the Foundation, sunlight was a luxury, and for four days now his skin, treated beforehand for
    ray resistance, had not felt the harshness of clothing, except for the brief shorts.

    Bayta huddled close to him on the sand and they spoke in whispers.

    Toran's voice was gloomy, as it drifted upwards from a relaxed face, "No, I admit we're
    nowhere. But where is he? Who is he? This mad world says nothing of him. Perhaps he doesn't
    exist."

    "He exists," replied Bayta, with lips that didn't move. "He's clever, that's all. And your uncle is
    right. He's a man we could use - if there's time."

    A short pause. Toran whispered, "Know what I've been doing, Bay? I'm just daydreaming
    myself into a sun-stupor. Things figure themselves out so neatly - so sweetly." His voice nearly
    trailed off, then returned, "Remember the way Dr. Amann talked back at college, Bay. The
    Foundation can never lose, but that does not mean the rulers of the Foundation can't. Didn't the
    real history of the Foundation begin when Salvor Hardin kicked out the Encyclopedists and took
    over the planet Terminus as the first mayor? And then in the next century, didn't Hober Mallow
    gain power by methods almost as drastic? That's twice the rulers were defeated, so it can be
    done. So why not by us?"

    "It's the oldest argument in the books. Torie. What a waste of good reverie."

    "Is it? Follow it out. What's Haven? Isn't it part of the Foundation? If we become top dog, it's still
    the Foundation winning, and only the current rulers losing."

    "Lots of difference between 'we can' and 'we will.' You're just jabbering."

    Toran squirmed. "Nuts, Bay, you're just in one of your sour, green moods. What do you want to
    spoil my fun for? I'll just go to sleep if you don't mind."

    But Bayta was craning her head, and suddenly - quite a non sequitur - she giggled, and
    removed her glasses to look down the beach with only her palm shading her eyes.

    Toran looked up, then lifted and twisted his shoulders to follow her glance.

    Apparently, she was watching a spindly figure, feet in air, who teetered on his hands for the



    amusement of a haphazard crowd. It was one of the swarming acrobatic beggars of the shore,
    whose supple joints bent and snapped for the sake of the thrown coins.

    A beach guard was motioning him on his way and with a surprising one-handed balance, the
    clown brought a thumb to his nose in an upside-down gesture. The guard advanced
    threateningly and reeled backward with a foot in his stomach. The clown righted himself without
    interrupting the motion of the initial kick and was away, while the frothing guard was held off by
    a thoroughly unsympathetic crowd.

    The clown made his way raggedly down the beach. He brushed past many, hesitated often,
    stopped nowhere. The original crowd had dispersed. The guard had departed.

    "He's a queer fellow," said Bayta, with amusement, and Toran agreed indifferently. The clown
    was close enough now to be seen clearly. His thin face drew together in front into a nose of
    generous planes and fleshy tip that seemed all but prehensile. His long, lean limbs and spidery
    body, accentuated by his costume, moved easily and with grace, but with just a suggestion of
    having been thrown together at random.

    To look was to smile.

    The clown seemed suddenly aware of their regard, for he stopped after he had passed, and,
    with a sharp turn, approached. His large, brown eyes fastened upon Bayta.

    She found herself disconcerted.

    The clown smiled, but it only saddened his beaked face, and when he spoke it was with the
    soft, elaborate phrasing of the Central Sectors.

    "Were I to use the wits the good Spirits gave me," he said, "then I would say this lady can not
    exist - for what sane man would hold a dream to be reality. Yet rather would I not be sane and
    lend belief to charmed, enchanted eyes."

    Bayta's own eyes opened wide. She said, "Wow!"

    Toran laughed, "Oh, you enchantress. Go ahead, Bay, that deserves a five-credit piece. Let
    him have it."

    But the clown was forward with a jump. "No, my lady, mistake me not. I spoke for money not at
    all, but for bright eyes and sweet face."

    "Well, thanks," then, to Toran, "Golly, you think the sun's in his eyes?"

    "Yet not alone for eyes and face," babbled the clown, as his words hurled past each other in
    heightened frenzy, "but also for a mind, clear and sturdy - and kind as well."

    Toran rose to his feet, reached for the white robe he had crooked his arm about for four days,
    and slipped into it.

    "Now, bud," he said, "suppose you tell me what you want, and stop annoying the lady."

    The clown fell back a frightened step, his meager body cringing. "Now, sure I meant no harm. I



    am a stranger here, and it's been said I am of addled wits; yet there is something in a face that I
    can read. Behind this lady's fairness, there is a heart that's kind, and that would help me in my
    trouble for all I speak so boldly."

    "Will five credits cure your trouble?" said Toran, dryly, and held out the coin.

    But the clown did not move to take it, and Bayta said, "Let me talk to him, Torie," She added
    swiftly, and in an undertone, "There's no use being annoyed at his silly way of talking. That's
    just his dialect; and our speech is probably as strange to him."

    She said, "What is your trouble? You're not worried about the guard, are you? He won't bother
    you."

    "Oh, no, not he. He's but a windlet that blows the dust about my ankles. There is another that I
    flee, and he is a storm that sweeps the worlds aside and throws them plunging at each other. A
    week ago, I ran away, have slept in city streets, and hid in city crowds. I've looked in many
    faces for help in need. I find it here." He repeated the last phrase in softer, anxious tones, and
    his large eyes were troubled, "I find it here."

    "Now," said Bayta, reasonably, "I would like to help, but really, friend, I'm no protection against
    a world-sweeping storm. To be truthful about it, I could use-"

    There was an uplifted, powerful voice that bore down upon them.

    "Now, then, you mud-spawned rascal-"

    It was the beach guard, with a fire-red face, and snarling mouth, that approached at a run. He
    pointed with his low-power stun pistol.

    "Hold him, you two. Don't let him get away." His heavy hand fell upon the clown's thin shoulder,
    so that a whimper was squeezed out of him.

    Toran said, "What's he done?"

    "What's he done? What's he done? Well, now, that's good!" The guard reached inside the
    dangling pocket attached to his belt, and removed a purple handkerchief, with which he
    mopped his bare neck. He said with relish. "I'll tell you what he's done. He's run away. The
    word's all over Kalgan and I would have recognized him before this if he had been on his feet
    instead of on his hawkface top." And he rattled his prey in a fierce good humor.

    Bayta said with a smile, "Now where did he escape from, sir?"

    The guard raised his voice. A crowd was gathering, popeyed and jabbering, and with the
    increase of audience, the guard's sense of importance increased in direct ratio.

    "Where did he escape from?" he declaimed in high sarcasm. "Why, I suppose you've heard of
    the Mule, now."

    All jabbering stopped, and Bayta felt a sudden iciness trickle down into her stomach. The clown
    had eyes only for her-he still quivered in the guard's brawny grasp.

    "And who," continued the guard heavily, "would this infernal ragged piece be, but his lordship's



    own court fool who's run away." He jarred his captive with a massive shake, "Do you admit it,
    fool?"


    There was only white fear for answer, and the soundless sibilance of Bayta's voice close to
    Toran's ear.

    Toran stepped forward to the guard in friendly fashion, "Now, my man, suppose you take your
    hand away for just a while. This entertainer you hold has been dancing for us and has not yet
    danced out his fee."

    "Here!" The guard's voice rose in sudden concern. "There's a reward-"

    "You'll have it, if you can prove he's the man you want. Suppose you withdraw till then. You
    know that you're interfering with a guest, which could be serious for you."

    "But you're interfering with his lordship and that will be serious for you." He shook the clown
    once again. "Return the man's fee, carrion."

    Toran's hand moved quickly and the guard's stun pistol was wrenched away with half a finger
    nearly following it. The guard howled his pain and rage. Toran shoved him violently aside, and
    the clown, unhanded, scuttled behind him.

    The crowd, whose fringes were now lost to the eye, paid little attention to the latest
    development. There was among them a craning of necks, and a centrifugal motion as if many
    had decided to increase their distance from the center of activity.

    Then there was a bustle, and a rough order in the distance. A corridor formed itself and two
    men strode through, electric whips in careless readiness. Upon each purple blouse was
    designed an angular shaft of lightning with a splitting planet underneath.

    A dark giant, in lieutenant's uniform, followed them; dark of skin, and hair, and scowl.

    The dark man spoke with the dangerous softness that meant he had little need of shouting to
    enforce his whims. He said, "Are you the man who notified us?"

    The guard was still holding his wrenched hand, and with a pain-distorted face mumbled, "I
    claim the reward, your mightiness, and I accuse that man-"

    "You'll get your reward," said the lieutenant, without looking at him. He motioned curtly to his
    men, "Take him."

    Toran felt the clown tearing at his robe with a maddened grip.

    He raised his voice and kept it from shaking, "I'm sorry, lieutenant; this man is mine."

    The soldiers took the statement without blinking. One raised his whip casually, but the
    lieutenant's snapped order brought it down.

    His dark mightiness swung forward and planted his square body before Toran, "Who are you?"
    And the answer rang out, "A citizen of the Foundation."



    It worked-with the crowd, at any rate. The pent-up silence broke into an intense hum. The
    Mule's name might excite fear, but it was, after all, a new name and scarcely stuck as deeply in
    the vitals as the old one of the Foundation - that had destroyed the Empire - and the fear of
    which ruled a quadrant of the Galaxy with ruthless despotism.

    The lieutenant kept face. He said, "Are you aware of the identity of the man behind you?"

    "I have been told he's a runaway from the court of your leader, but my only sure knowledge is
    that he is a friend of mine. You'll need firm proof of his identity to take him."

    There were high-pitched sighs from the crowd, but the lieutenant let it pass. "Have you your
    papers of Foundation citizenship with you?"

    "At my ship."

    "You realize that your actions are illegal? I can have you shot."

    "Undoubtedly. But then you would have shot a Foundation citizen and it is quite likely that your
    body would be sent to the Foundation - quartered - as part compensation. It's been done by
    other warlords."

    The lieutenant wet his lips. The statement was true.

    He said, "Your name?"

    Toran followed up his advantage, "I will answer further questions at my ship. You can get the
    cell number at the Hangar; it is registered under the name 'Bayta'."

    "You won't give up the runaway?"

    "To the Mule, perhaps. Send your master!"

    The conversation had degenerated to a whisper and the lieutenant turned sharply away.
    "Disperse the crowd!" he said to his men, with suppressed ferocity.

    The electric whips rose and fell. There were shrieks and a vast surge of separation and flight.

    Toran interrupted his reverie only once on their way back to the Hangar. He said, almost to
    himself, "Galaxy, Bay, what a time I had! I was so scared-"

    "Yes," she said, with a voice that still shook, and eyes that still showed something akin to
    worship, "it was quite out of character."

    "Well, I still don't know what happened. I just got up there with a stun pistol that I wasn't even
    sure I knew how to use, and talked back to him. I don't know why I did it."

    He looked across the aisle of the short-run air vessel that was carrying them out of the beach
    area, to the seat on which the Mule's clown scrunched up in sleep, and added distastefully, "It
    was the hardest thing I've ever done."

    The lieutenant stood respectfully before the colonel of the garrison, and the colonel looked at
    him and said, "Well done. Your part's over now."



    But the lieutenant did not retire immediately. He said darkly, "The Mule has lost face before a
    mob, sir. It will be necessary to undertake disciplinary action to restore proper atmosphere of
    respect."

    "Those measures have already been taken."

    The lieutenant half turned, then, almost with resentment, "I'm willing to agree, sir, that orders
    are orders, but standing before that man with his stun pistol and swallowing his insolence
    whole, was the hardest thing I've ever done."


    14. THE MUTANT

    The "hangar" on Kalgan is an institution peculiar unto itself, born of the need for the disposition
    of the vast number of ships brought in by the visitors from abroad, and the simultaneous and
    consequent vast need for living accommodations for the same. The original bright one who had
    thought of the obvious solution had quickly become a millionaire. His heirs - by birth or finance
    - were easily among the richest on Kalgan.

    The "hangar" spreads fatly over square miles of territory, and "hangar" does not describe it at
    all sufficiently. It is essentially a hotel - for ships. The traveler pays in advance and his ship is
    awarded a berth from which it can take off into space at any desired moment. The visitor then
    lives in his ship as always. The ordinary hotel services such as the replacement of food and
    medical supplies at special rates, simple servicing of the ship itself, special intra-Kalgan
    transportation for a nominal sum are to be had, of course.

    As a result, the visitor combines hangar space and hotel bill into one, at a saving. The owners
    sell temporary use of ground space at ample profits. The government collects huge taxes.
    Everyone has fun. Nobody loses. Simple!

    The man who made his way down the shadow-borders of the wide corridors that connected the
    multitudinous wings of the "hangar" had in the past speculated on the novelty and usefulness of
    the system described above, but these were reflections for idle moments - distinctly unsuitable
    at present.

    The ships hulked in their height and breadth down the long lines of carefully aligned cells, and
    the man discarded line after line. He was an expert at what he was doing now and if his
    preliminary study of the hangar registry had failed to give specific information beyond the
    doubtful indication of a specific wing - one containing hundreds of ships - his specialized
    knowledge could winnow those hundreds into one.

    There was the ghost of a sigh in the silence, as the man stopped and faded down one of the
    lines; a crawling insect beneath the notice of the arrogant metal monsters that rested there.

    Here and there the sparkling of light from a porthole would indicate the presence of an early
    returner from the organized pleasures to simpler - or more private - pleasures of his own.

    The man halted, and would have smiled if he ever smiled. Certainly the convolutions of his



    brain performed the mental equivalent of a smile.

    The ship he stopped at was sleek and obviously fast. The peculiarity of its design was what he
    wanted. It was not a usual model - and these days most of the ships of this quadrant of the
    Galaxy either imitated Foundation design or were built by Foundation technicians. But this was
    special. This was a Foundation ship - if only because of the tiny bulges in the skin that were
    the nodes of the protective screen that only a Foundation ship could possess. There were other
    indications, too.

    The man felt no hesitation.

    The electronic barrier strung across the line of the ships as a concession to privacy on the part
    of the management was not at all important to him. It parted easily, and without activating the
    alarm, at the use of the very special neutralizing force he had at his disposal.

    So the first knowledge within the ship of the intruder without was the casual and almost friendly
    signal of the muted buzzer in the ship's living room that was the result of a palm placed over the
    little photocell just one side of the main air lock.

    And while that successful search went on, Toran and Bayta felt only the most precarious
    security within the steel walls of the Bayta. The Mule's clown who had reported that within his
    narrow compass of body he held the lordly name of Magnifico Giganticus, sat hunched over the
    table and gobbled at the food set before him.

    His sad, brown eyes lifted from his meat only to follow Bayta's movements in the combined
    kitchen and larder where he ate.

    "The thanks of a weak one are of but little value," he muttered, "but you have them, for truly, in
    this past week, little but scraps have come my way - and for all my body is small, yet is my
    appetite unseemly great."

    "Well, then, eat!" said Bayta, with a smile. "Don't waste your time on thanks. Isn't there a
    Central Galaxy proverb about gratitude that I once heard?"

    "Truly there is, my lady. For a wise man, I have been told, once said, 'Gratitude is best and
    most effective when it does not evaporate itself in empty phrases.' But alas, my lady, I am but a
    mass of empty phrases, it would seem. When my empty phrases pleased the Mule, it brought
    me a court dress, and a grand name - for, see you, it was originally simply Bobo, one that
    pleases him not - and then when my empty phrases pleased him not, it would bring upon my
    poor bones beatings and whippings."

    Toran entered from the pilot room, "Nothing to do now but wait, Bay. I hope the Mule is capable
    of understanding that a Foundation ship is Foundation territory."

    Magnifico Giganticus, once Bobo, opened his eyes wide and exclaimed, "How great is the
    Foundation before which even the cruel servants of the Mule tremble."

    "Have you heard of the Foundation, too?" asked Bayta, with a little smile.

    "And who has not?" Magnifico's voice was a mysterious whisper. "There are those who say it is



    a world of great magic, of fires that can consume planets, and secrets of mighty strength. They
    say that not the highest nobility of the Galaxy could achieve the honor and deference
    considered only the natural due of a simple man who could say 'I am a citizen of the
    Foundation,' - were he only a salvage miner of space, or a nothing like myself."

    Bayta said, "Now, Magnifico, you'll never finish if you make speeches. Here, I'll get you a little
    flavored milk. It's good."

    She placed a pitcher of it upon the table and motioned Toran out of the room.

    "Torie, what are we going to do now - about him?" and she motioned towards the kitchen.

    "How do you mean?"

    "If the Mule comes, are we going to give him up?"

    "Well, what else, Bay?" He sounded harassed, and the gesture with which he shoved back the
    moist curl upon his forehead testified to that.

    He continued impatiently, "Before I came here I had a sort of vague idea that all we had to do
    was to ask for the Mule, and then get down to business - just business, you know, nothing
    definite."

    "I know what you mean, Torie. I wasn't much hoping to see the Mule myself, but I did think we
    could pick up some firsthand knowledge of the mess, and then pass it over to people who know
    a little more about this interstellar intrigue. I'm no storybook spy."

    "You're not behind me, Bay." He folded his arms and frowned. "What a situation! You'd never
    know there was a person like the Mule, except for this last queer break. Do you suppose he'll
    come for his clown?"

    Bayta looked up at him. "I don't know that I want him to. I don't know what to say or do. Do
    you?"

    The inner buzzer sounded with its intermittent burring noise. Bayta's lips moved wordlessly,
    "The Mule!"

    Magnifico was in the doorway, eyes wide, his voice a whimper, "The Mule?"

    Toran murmured, "I've got to let them in."

    A contact opened the air lock and the outer door closed behind the newcomer. The scanner
    showed only a single shadowed figure.

    "It's only one person," said Toran, with open relief, and his voice was almost shaky as he bent
    toward the signal tube, "Who are you?"

    "You'd better let me in and find out, hadn't you?" The words came thinly out the receiver.

    "I'll inform you that this is a Foundation ship and consequently Foundation territory by
    international treaty."



    "I know that."

    "Come with your arms free, or I'll shoot. I'm well-armed."

    "Done!"

    Toran opened the inner door and closed contact on his blast pistol, thumb hovering over the
    pressure point. There was the sound of footsteps and then the door swung open, and Magnifico
    cried out, "It's not the Mule. It's but a man."

    The "man" bowed to the clown somberly, "Very accurate. I'm not the Mule." He held his hands
    apart, "I'm not armed, and I come on a peaceful errand. You might relax and put the blast pistol
    away. Your hand isn't steady enough for my peace of mind."

    "Who are you?" asked Toran, brusquely.

    "I might ask you that," said the stranger, coolly, "since you're the one under false pretenses, not
    I."

    "How so?"

    "You're the one who claims to be a Foundation citizen when there's not an authorized Trader
    on the planet."

    "That's not so. How would you know?"

    "Because I am a Foundation citizen, and have my papers to prove it. Where are yours?"

    "I think you'd better get out."

    "I think not. If you know anything about Foundation methods, and despite your imposture you
    might, you'd know that if I don't return alive to my ship at a specified time, there'll be a signal at
    the nearest Foundation headquarters so I doubt if your weapons will have much effect,
    practically speaking."

    There was an irresolute silence and then Bayta said, calmly, "Put the blaster away, Toran, and
    take him at face value. He sounds like the real thing."

    "Thank you," said the stranger.

    Toran put his gun on the chair beside him, "Suppose you explain all this now."

    The stranger remained standing. He was long of bone and large of limb. His face consisted of
    hard flat planes and it was somehow evident that he never smiled. But his eyes lacked
    hardness.

    He said, "News travels quickly, especially when it is apparently beyond belief. I don't suppose
    there's a person on Kalgan who doesn't know that the Mule's men were kicked in the teeth
    today by two tourists from the Foundation. I knew of the important details before evening, and,
    as I said, there are no Foundation tourists aside from myself on the planet. We know about
    those things."



    Who are the 'we'?


    "'We' are - 'we'! Myself for one! I knew you were at the Hangar - you had been overheard to
    say so. I had my ways of checking the registry, and my ways of finding the ship."

    He turned to Bayta suddenly, "You're from the Foundation - by birth, aren't you?"

    "Am I?"

    "You're a member of the democratic opposition - they call it 'the underground.' I don't
    remember your name, but I do the face. You got out only recently - and wouldn't have if you
    were more important."

    Bayta shrugged, "You know a lot."

    "I do. You escaped with a man. That one?"

    "Does it matter what I say?"

    "No. I merely want a thorough mutual understanding. I believe that the password during the
    week you left so hastily was 'Seldon, Hardin, and Freedom.' Porfirat Hart was your section
    leader. "

    "Where'd you get that?" Bayta was suddenly fierce. "Did the police get him?" Toran held her
    back, but she shook herself loose and advanced.

    The man from the Foundation said quietly, "Nobody has him. It's just that the underground
    spreads widely and in queer places. I'm Captain Han Pritcher of Information, and I'm a section
    leader myself - never mind under what name."

    He waited, then said, "No, you don't have to believe me. In our business it is better to overdo
    suspicion than the opposite. But I'd better get past the preliminaries."

    "Yes," said Toran, "suppose you do."

    "May I sit down? Thanks." Captain Pritcher swung a long leg across his knee and let an arm
    swing loose over the back of the chair. "I'll start out by saying that I don't know what all this is
    about - from your angle. You two aren't from the Foundation, but it's not a hard guess that
    you're from one of the independent Trading worlds. That doesn't bother me overmuch. But out
    of curiosity, what do you want with that fellow, that clown you snatched to safety? You're risking
    your life to hold on to him."

    "I can't tell you that."

    "Hm-m-m. Well, I didn't think you would. But if you're waiting for the Mule himself to come
    behind a fanfarade of horns, drums, and electric organs - relax! The Mule doesn't work that
    way."

    "What?" It came from both Toran and Bayta, and in the comer where Magnifico lurked with ears
    almost visibly expanded, there was a sudden joyful start.

    "That's right. I've been trying to contact him myself, and doing a rather more thorough job of it



    than you two amateurs can. It won't work. The man makes no personal appearance, does not
    allow himself to be photographed or simulated, and is seen only by his most intimate
    associates."

    "Is that supposed to explain your interest in us, captain?" questioned Toran.

    "No. That clown is the key. That clown is one of the very few that have seen him. I want him.

    He may be the proof I need - and I need something, Galaxy knows - to awaken the
    Foundation."

    "It needs awakening?" broke in Bayta with sudden sharpness. "Against what? And in what role
    do you act as alarm, that of rebel democrat or of secret police and provocateur?"

    The captain's face set in its hard lines. "When the entire Foundation is threatened, Madame
    Revolutionary, both democrats and tyrants perish. Let us save the tyrants from a greater, that
    we may overthrow them in their turn."

    "Who's the greater tyrant you speak of?" flared Bayta.

    "The Mule! I know a bit about him, enough to have been my death several times over already, if
    I had moved less nimbly. Send the clown out of the room. This will require privacy."

    "Magnifico," said Bayta, with a gesture, and the clown left without a sound.

    The captain's voice was grave and intense, and low enough so that Toran and Bayta drew
    close.

    He said, "The Mule is a shrewd operator - far too shrewd not to realize the advantage of the
    magnetism and glamour of personal leadership. If he gives that up, it's for a reason. That
    reason must be the fact that personal contact would reveal something that is of overwhelming
    importance not to reveal."

    He waved aside questions, and continued more quickly, "I went back to his birthplace for this,
    and questioned people who for their knowledge will not live long. Few enough are still alive.
    They remember the baby born thirty years before - the death of his mother - his strange youth.
    The Mule is not a human being!"

    And his two listeners drew back in horror at the misty implications. Neither understood, fully or
    clearly, but the menace of the phrase was definite.

    The captain continued, "He is a mutant, and obviously from his subsequent career, a highly
    successful one. I don't know his powers or the exact extent to which he is what our thrillers
    would call a 'superman,' but the rise from nothing to the conqueror of Kalgan's warlord in two
    years is revealing. You see, don't you, the danger? Can a genetic accident of unpredictable
    biological properties be taken into account in the Seldon plan?"

    Slowly, Bayta spoke, "I don't believe it. This is some sort of complicated trickery. Why didn't the
    Mule's men kill us when they could have, if he's a superman?"

    "I told you that I don't know the extent of his mutation. He may not be ready, yet, for the
    Foundation, and it would be a sign of the greatest wisdom to resist provocation until ready. Now



    let me speak to the clown."

    The captain faced the trembling Magnifico, who obviously distrusted this huge, hard man who
    faced him.

    The captain began slowly, "Have you seen the Mule with your own eyes?"

    "I have but too well, respected sir. And felt the weight of his arm with my own body as well."

    "I have no doubt of that. Can you describe him?"

    "It is frightening to recall him, respected sir. He is a man of mighty frame. Against him, even you
    would be but a spindling. His hair is of a burning crimson, and with all my strength and weight I
    could not pull down his arm, once extended - not a hair's thickness." Magnifico's thinness
    seemed to collapse upon itself in a huddle of arms and legs. "Often, to amuse his generals or to
    amuse only himself, he would suspend me by one finger in my belt from a fearful height, while I
    chattered poetry. It was only after the twentieth verse that I was withdrawn, and each
    improvised and each a perfect rhyme, or else start over. He is a man of overpowering might,
    respected sir, and cruel in the use of his power - and his eyes, respected sir, no one sees."

    "What? What's that last?"

    "He wears spectacles, respected sir, of a curious nature. It is said that they are opaque and that
    he sees by a powerful magic that far transcends human powers. I have heard," and his voice
    was small and mysterious, "that to see his eyes is to see death; that he kills with his eyes,
    respected sir."

    Magnifico's eyes wheeled quickly from one watching face to another. He quavered, "It is true.

    As I live, it is true. "

    Bayta drew a long breath, "Sounds like you're right, captain. Do you want to take over?"

    "Well, let's look at the situation. You don't owe anything here? The hangar's barrier above is
    free?"

    "I can leave any time."

    "Then leave. The Mule may not wish to antagonize the Foundation, but he runs a frightful risk in
    letting Magnifico get away. It probably accounts for the hue and cry after the poor devil in the
    first place. So there may be ships waiting for you upstairs. If you're lost in space, who's to pin
    the crime?"

    "You're right," agreed Toran, bleakly.

    "However, you've got a shield and you're probably speedier than anything they've got, so as
    soon as you're clear of the atmosphere make the circle in neutral to the other hemisphere, then
    just cut a track outwards at top acceleration."

    "Yes," said Bayta coldly, "and when we are back on the Foundation, what then, captain?"

    "Why, you are then co-operative citizens of Kalgan, are you not? I know nothing to the contrary,
    do I?"



    Nothing was said. Toran turned to the controls. There was an imperceptible lurch.

    It was when Toran had left Kalgan sufficiently far in the rear to attempt his first interstellar jump,
    that Captain Pritcher's face first creased slightly - for no ship of the Mule had in any way
    attempted to bar their leaving.

    "Looks like he's letting us carry off Magnifico," said Toran. "Not so good for your story."

    "Unless," corrected the captain, "he wants us to carry him off, in which case it's not so good for
    the Foundation."

    It was after the last jump, when within neutral-flight distance of the Foundation, that the first
    hyperwave news broadcast reached the ship.

    And there was one news item barely mentioned. It seemed that a warlord - unidentified by the
    bored speaker - had made representations to the Foundation concerning the forceful abduction
    of a member of his court. The announcer went on to the sports news.

    Captain Pritcher said icily, "He's one step ahead of us after all." Thoughtfully, he added, "He's
    ready for the Foundation, and he uses this as an excuse for action. It makes things more
    difficult for us. We will have to act before we are really ready."


    15. THE PSYCHOLOGIST

    There was reason to the fact that the element known as "pure science" was the freest form of
    life on the Foundation. In a Galaxy where the predominance - and even survival - of the
    Foundation still rested upon the superiority of its technology - even despite its large access of
    physical power in the last century and a half - a certain immunity adhered to The Scientist. He
    was needed, and he knew it.

    Likewise, there was reason to the fact that Ebling Mis - only those who did not know him added
    his titles to his name - was the freest form of life in the "pure science" of the Foundation. In a
    world where science was respected, he was The Scientist - with capital letters and no smile.

    He was needed, and he knew it.

    And so it happened, that when others bent their knee, he refused and added loudly that his
    ancestors in their time bowed no knee to any stinking mayor. And in his ancestors' time the
    mayor was elected anyhow, and kicked out at will, and that the only people that inherited
    anything by right of birth were the congenital idiots.

    So it also happened, that when Ebling Mis decided to allow Indbur to honor him with an
    audience, he did not wait for the usual rigid line of command to pass his request up and the
    favored reply down, but, having thrown the less disreputable of his two formal jackets over his
    shoulders and pounded an odd hat of impossible design on one side of his head, and lit a
    forbidden cigar into the bargain, he barged past two ineffectually bleating guards and into the
    mayor's palace.

    The first notice his excellence received of the intrusion was when from his garden he heard the



    gradually nearing uproar of expostulation and the answering bull-roar of inarticulate swearing.

    Slowly, Indbur lay down his trowel; slowly, he stood up; and slowly, he frowned. For Indbur
    allowed himself a daily vacation from work, and for two hours in the early afternoon, weather
    permitting, he was in his garden. There in his garden, the blooms grew in squares and
    triangles, interlaced in a severe order of red and yellow, with little dashes of violet at the apices,
    and greenery bordering the whole in rigid lines. There in his garden no one disturbed him - no
    one!

    Indbur peeled off his soil-stained gloves as he advanced toward the little garden door.

    Inevitably, he said, "What is the meaning of this?"

    It is the precise question and the precise wording thereof that has been put to the atmosphere
    on such occasions by an incredible variety of men since humanity was invented. It is not
    recorded that it has ever been asked for any purpose other than dignified effect.

    But the answer was literal this time, for Mis's body came plunging through with a bellow, and a
    shake of a fist at the ones who were still holding tatters of his cloak.

    Indbur motioned them away with a solemn, displeased frown, and Mis bent to pick up his ruin of
    a hat, shake about a quarter of the gathered dirt off it, thrust it under his armpit and say:

    "Look here, Indbur, those unprintable minions of yours will be charged for one good cloak. Lots
    of good wear left in this cloak." He puffed and wiped his forehead with just a trace of
    theatricality.

    The mayor stood stiff with displeasure, and said haughtily from the peak of his five-foot-two, "It
    has not been brought to my attention, Mis, that you have requested an audience. You have
    certainly not been assigned one."

    Ebling Mis looked down at his mayor with what was apparently shocked disbelief, "Ga-LAX-y,
    Indbur, didn't you get my note yesterday? I handed it to a flunky in purple uniform day before. I
    would have handed it to you direct, but I know how you like formality."

    "Formality!" Indbur turned up exasperated eyes. Then, strenuously, "Have you ever heard of
    proper organization? At all future times you are to submit your request for an audience,
    properly made out in triplicate, at the government office intended for the purpose. You are then
    to wait until the ordinary course of events brings you notification of the time of audience to be
    granted. You are then to appear, properly clothed - properly clothed, do you understand - and
    with proper respect, too. You may leave."

    "What's wrong with my clothes?" demanded Mis, hotly. "Best cloak I had till those unprintable
    fiends got their claws on it. I'll leave just as soon as I deliver what I came to deliver. "Ga-LAX-y,
    if it didn't involve a Seldon Crisis, I would leave right now."

    "Seldon crisis!" Indbur exhibited first interest. Mis was a great psychologist - a democrat, boor,
    and rebel certainly, but a psychologist, too. In his uncertainty, the mayor even failed to put into
    words the inner pang that stabbed suddenly when Mis plucked a casual bloom, held it to his
    nostrils expectantly, then flipped it away with a wrinkled nose.



    Indbur said coldly, "Would you follow me? This garden wasn't made for serious conversation."

    He felt better in his built-up chair behind his large desk from which he could look down on the
    few hairs that quite ineffectually hid Mis's pink scalp-skin. He felt much better when Mis cast a
    series of automatic glances about him for a non-existent chair and then remained standing in
    uneasy shifting fashion. He felt best of all when in response to a careful pressure of the correct
    contact, a liveried underling scurried in, bowed his way to the desk, and laid thereon a bulky,
    metal-bound volume.

    "Now, in order," said Indbur, once more master of the situation, "to make this unauthorized
    interview as short as possible, make your statement in the fewest possible words."

    Ebling Mis said unhurriedly, "You know what I'm doing these days?"

    "I have your reports here," replied the mayor, with satisfaction, "together with authorized
    summaries of them. As I understand it, your investigations into the mathematics of
    psychohistory have been intended to duplicate Hari Seldon's work and, eventually, trace the
    projected course of future history, for the use of the Foundation."

    "Exactly," said Mis, dryly. "When Seldon first established the Foundation, he was wise enough
    to include no psychologists among the scientists placed here - so that the Foundation has
    always worked blindly along the course of historical necessity. In the course of my researches, I
    have based a good deal upon hints found at the Time Vault."

    "I am aware of that, Mis. It is a waste of time to repeat."

    "I'm not repeating," blared Mis, "because what I'm going to tell you isn't in any of those reports."

    "How do you mean, not in the reports?" said Indbur, stupidly. "How could-"

    "Ga-LAX-y, Let me tell this my own way, you offensive little creature. Stop putting words into
    my mouth and questioning my every statement or I'll tramp out of here and let everything
    crumble around you. Remember, you unprintable fool, the Foundation will come through
    because it must, but if I walk out of here now - you won't."

    Dashing his hat on the floor, so that clods of earth scattered, he sprang up the stairs of the dais
    on which the wide desk stood and shoving papers violently, sat down upon a comer of it.

    Indbur thought frantically of summoning the guard, or using the built-in blasters of his desk. But
    Mis's face was glaring down upon him and there was nothing to do but cringe the best face
    upon it.

    "Dr. Mis," he began, with weak formality, "you must-"

    "Shut up," said Mis, ferociously, "and listen. If this thing here," and his palm came down heavily
    on the metal of the bound data, "is a mess of my reports - throw it out. Any report I write goes
    up through some twenty-odd officials, gets to you, and then sort of winds down through twenty
    more. That's fine if there's nothing you don't want kept secret. Well, I've got something
    confidential here. It's so confidential, even the boys working for me haven't got wind of it. They
    did the work, of course, but each just a little unconnected piece - and I put it together. You



    know what the Time Vault is?


    Indbur nodded his head, but Mis went on with loud enjoyment of the situation, "Well, I'll tell you
    anyhow because I've been sort of imagining this unprintable situation for a "Ga-LAX-y, of a long
    time; I can read your mind, you puny fraud. You've got your hand right near a little knob that'll
    call in about five hundred or so armed men to finish me off, but you're afraid of what I know -
    you're afraid of a Seldon Crisis. Besides which, if you touch anything on your desk, I'll knock
    your unprintable head off before anyone gets here. You and your bandit father and pirate
    grandfather have been blood-sucking the Foundation long enough anyway."

    "This is treason," gabbled Indbur.

    "It certainly is," gloated Mis, "but what are you going to do about it? Let me tell you about the
    Time Vault. That Time Vault is what Hari Seldon placed here at the beginning to help us over
    the rough spots. For every crisis, Seldon has prepared a personal simulacrum to help - and
    explain. Four crises so far - four appearances. The first time he appeared at the height of the
    first crisis. The second time, he appeared at the moment just after the successful evolution of
    the second crisis. Our ancestors were there to listen to him both times. At the third and fourth
    crises, he was ignored - probably because he was not needed, but recent investigations -not
    included in those reports you have - indicate that he appeared anyway, and at the proper
    times. Get it?"

    Fie did not wait for any answer. His cigar, a tattered, dead ruin was finally disposed of, a new
    cigar groped for, and lit. The smoke puffed out violently.

    Fie said, "Officially I've been trying to rebuild the science of psychohistory. Well, no one man is
    going to do that, and it won't get done in any one century, either. But I've made advances in the
    more simple elements and I've been able to use it as an excuse to meddle with the Time Vault.
    What I have done, involves the determination, to a pretty fair kind of certainty, of the exact date
    of the next appearance of Hari Seldon. I can give you the exact day, in other words, that the
    coming Seldon Crisis, the fifth, will reach its climax. "

    "Flow far off?" demanded Indbur, tensely.

    And Mis exploded his bomb with cheerful nonchalance,

    "Four months," he said. "Four unprintable months, less two days."

    "Four months," said Indbur, with uncharacteristic vehemence. "Impossible."

    "Impossible, my unprintable eye."

    "Four months? Do you understand what that means? For a crisis to come to a head in four
    months would mean that it has been preparing for years."

    "And why not? Is there a law of Nature that requires the process to mature in the full light of
    day?"

    "But nothing impends. Nothing hangs over us." Indbur almost wrung his hands for anxiety. With
    a sudden spasmodic recrudescence of ferocity, he screamed, "Will you get off my desk and let



    me put it in order? How do you expect me to think?"

    Mis, startled, lifted heavily and moved aside.

    Indbur replaced objects in their appropriate niches with a feverish motion. He was speaking
    quickly, "You have no right to come here like this. If you had presented your theory-"

    "It is not a theory. "

    "I say it is a theory. If you had presented it together with your evidence and arguments, in
    appropriate fashion, it would have gone to the Bureau of Historical Sciences. There it could
    have been properly treated, the resulting analyses submitted to me, and then, of course, proper
    action would have been taken. As it is, you've vexed me to no purpose. Ah, here it is."

    He had a sheet of transparent, silvery paper in his hand which he shook at the bulbous
    psychologist beside him.

    "This is a short summary I prepare myself - weekly - of foreign matters in progress. Listen -
    we have completed negotiations for a commercial treaty with Mores, continue negotiations for
    one with Lyonesse, sent a delegation to some celebration or other on Bonde, received some
    complaint or other from Kalgan and we've promised to look into it, protested some sharp trade
    practices in Asperta and they've promised to look into it - and so on and so on." The mayor's
    eyes swarmed down the list of coded notations, and then he carefully placed the sheet in its
    proper place in the proper folder in the proper pigeonhole.

    I tell you, Mis, there's not a thing there that breathes anything but order and peace-"

    The door at the far, long end opened, and, in far too dramatically coincident a fashion to
    suggest anything but real life, a plainly-costumed notable stepped in.

    Indbur half-rose. He had the curiously swirling sensation of unreality that comes upon those
    days when too much happens. After Mis's intrusion and wild turnings there now came the
    equally improper, hence disturbing, intrusion unannounced, of his secretary, who at least knew
    the rules.

    The secretary kneeled low.

    Indbur said, sharply, "Well!"

    The secretary addressed the floor, "Excellence, Captain Han Pritcher of Information, returning
    from Kalgan, in disobedience to your orders, has according to prior instructions - your order
    X20-513 - been imprisoned, and awaits execution. Those accompanying him are being held for
    questioning. A full report has been filed."

    Indbur, in agony, said, "A full report has been received. Well!"

    "Excellence, Captain Pritcher has reported, vaguely, dangerous designs on the part of the new
    warlord of Kalgan. He has been given, according to prior instructions - your order X20-651 - no
    formal hearing, but his remarks have been recorded and a full report filed."


    Indbur screamed, "A full report has been received. Well!"



    "Excellence, reports have within the quarter-hour been received from the Salinnian frontier.
    Ships identified as Kalganian have been entering Foundation territory, unauthorized. The ships
    are armed. Fighting has occurred."

    The secretary was bent nearly double. Indbur remained standing. Ebling Mis shook himself,
    clumped up to the secretary, and tapped him sharply on the shoulder.

    "Flere, you'd better have them release this Captain Pritcher, and have him sent here. Get out."

    The secretary left, and Mis turned to the mayor, "Fladn't you better get the machinery moving,
    Indbur? Four months, you know."

    Indbur remained standing, glaze-eyed. Only one finger seemed alive - and it traced rapid jerky
    triangles on the smooth desk top before him.


    16. CONFERENCE

    When the twenty-seven independent Trading worlds, united only by their distrust of the mother
    planet of the Foundation, concert an assembly among themselves, and each is big with a pride
    grown of its smallness, hardened by its own insularity and embittered by eternal danger - there
    are preliminary negotiations to be overcome of a pettiness sufficiently staggering to heartsicken
    the most persevering.

    It is not enough to fix in advance such details as methods of voting, type of representation -
    whether by world or by population. These are matters of involved political importance. It is not
    enough to fix matters of priority at the table, both council and dinner, those are matters of
    involved social importance.

    It was the place of meeting - since that was a matter of overpowering provincialism. And in the
    end the devious routes of diplomacy led to the world of Radole, which some commentators had
    suggested at the start for logical reason of central position.

    Radole was a small world - and, in military potential, perhaps the weakest of the twenty-seven.
    That, by the way, was another factor in the logic of the choice.

    It was a ribbon world - of which the Galaxy boasts sufficient, but among which, the inhabited
    variety is a rarity for the physical requirements are difficult to meet. It was a world, in other
    words, where the two halves face the monotonous extremes of heat and cold, while the region
    of possible life is the girdling ribbon of the twilight zone.

    Such a world invariably sounds uninviting to those who have not tried it, but there exist spots,
    strategically placed - and Radole City was located in such a one.

    It spread along the soft slopes of the foothills before the hacked-out mountains that backed it
    along the rim of the cold hemisphere and held off the frightful ice. The warm, dry air of the
    sun-half spilled over, and from the mountains was piped the water-and between the two,

    Radole City became a continuous garden, swimming in the eternal morning of an eternal June.



    Each house nestled among its flower garden, open to the fangless elements. Each garden was
    a horticultural forcing ground, where luxury plants grew in fantastic patterns for the sake of the
    foreign exchange they brought - until Radole had almost become a producing world, rather
    than a typical Trading world.

    So, in its way, Radole City was a little point of softness and luxury on a horrible planet - a tiny
    scrap of Eden - and that, too, was a factor in the logic of the choice.

    The strangers came from each of the twenty-six other Trading worlds: delegates, wives,
    secretaries, newsmen, ships, and crews - and Radole's population nearly doubled and
    Radole's resources strained themselves to the limit. One ate at will, and drank at will, and slept
    not at all.

    Yet there were few among the roisterers who were not intensely aware that all that volume of
    the Galaxy burnt slowly in a sort of quiet, slumbrous war. And of those who were aware, there
    were dime classes. First, there were the many who knew little and were very confident.

    Such as the young space pilot who wore the Haven cockade on the clasp of his cap, and who
    managed, in holding his glass before his eyes, to catch those of the faintly smiling Radolian girl
    opposite. He was saying:

    "We came fight through the war-zone to get here-on purpose. We traveled about a light-minute
    or so, in neutral, right past Horleggor-"

    "Horleggor?" broke in a long-legged native, who was playing host to that particular gathering.
    "That's where the Mule got the guts beat out of him last week, wasn't it?"

    "Where'd you hear that the Mule got the guts beat out of him?" demanded the pilot, loftily.

    "Foundation radio."

    "Yeah? Well, the Mule's got Horleggor. We almost ran into a convoy of his ships, and that's
    where they were coming from. It isn't a gut-beating when you stay where you fought, and the
    gut-beater leaves in a hurry."

    Someone else said in a high, blurred voice, "Don't talk like that. Foundation always takes it on
    the chin for a while. You watch; just sit tight and watch. 01' Foundation knows when to come
    back. And then - pow T The thick voice concluded and was succeeded by a bleary grin.

    "Anyway." said the pilot from Haven, after a short pause, "As I say, we saw the Mule's ships,
    and they looked pretty good, pretty good. I tell you what - they looked new."

    "New?" said the native, thoughtfully. "They build them themselves?" He broke a leaf from an
    overhanging branch, sniffed delicately at it, then crunched it between his teeth, the bruised
    tissues bleeding greenly and diffusing a minty odor. He said, "You trying to tell me they beat
    Foundation ships with homebuilt jobs? Go on."

    "We saw them, doc. And I can tell a ship from a comet, too, you know."

    The native leaned close. "You know what I think. Listen, don't kid yourself. Wars don't just start
    by themselves, and we have a bunch of shrewd apples running things. They know what they're



    doing."

    The well-unthirsted one said with sudden loudness, "You watch ol' Foundation. They wait for
    the last minute, then - powf' He grinned with vacuously open mouth at the girl, who moved
    away from him.

    The Radolian was saying, "For instance, old man, you think maybe that this Mule guy's running
    things. No-o-o." And he wagged a finger horizontally. "The way I hear it, and from pretty high
    up, mind you, he's our boy. We're paying him off, and we probably built those ships. Let's be
    realistic about it - we probably did. Sure, he can't beat the Foundation in the long run, but he
    can get them shaky, and when he does - we get in."

    The girl said, "Is that all you can talk about, Kiev? The war? You make me tired."

    The pilot from Haven said, in an access of gallantry,

    "Change the subject. Can't make the girls tired."

    The bedewed one took up the refrain and banged a mug to the rhythm. The little groups of two
    that had formed broke up with giggles and swagger, and a few similar groups of twos emerged
    from the sun-house in the background.

    The conversation became more general, more varied, more meaningless.

    Then there were those who knew a little more and were less confident.

    Such as the one-armed Fran, whose large bulk represented Haven as official delegated, and
    who lived high in consequence, and cultivated new friendships - with women when he could
    and with men when he had to.

    It was on the sun platform of the hilltop home, of one of these new friends, that he relaxed for
    the first of what eventually proved to be a total of two times while on Radole. The new friend
    was Iwo Lyon, a kindred soul of Radole. Iwo's house was apart from the general cluster,
    apparently alone in a sea of floral perfume and insect chatter. The sun platform was a grassy
    strip of lawn set at a forty-five degree angle, and upon it Fran stretched out and fairly sopped
    up sun.

    He said, "Don't have anything like this on Haven."

    Iwo replied, sleepily, "Ever seen the cold side. There's a spot twenty miles from here where the
    oxygen runs like water. "

    "Go on.

    "Fact."

    "Well, I'll tell you, Iwo-ln the old days before my arm was chewed off I knocked around, see -
    and you won't believe this, but" - The story that followed lasted considerably, and Iwo didn't
    believe it.


    Iwo said, through yawns, "They don't make them like in the old days, that's the truth.



    "No, guess they don't. Well, now," Fran fired up, "don't say that. I told you about my son, didn't
    I? He's one of the old school, if you like. He'll make a great Trader, blast it. He's his old man up
    and down. Up and down, except that he gets married."

    "You mean legal contract? With a girl?"

    "That's right. Don't see the sense in it myself. They went to Kalgan for their honeymoon."
    "Kalgan? Kalgan? When the Galaxy was this?"

    Fran smiled broadly, and said with slow meaning, "Just before the Mule declared war on the
    Foundation."

    "That so?"

    Fran nodded and motioned Iwo closer with his head. He said, hoarsely, "In fact, I can tell you
    something, if you don't let it go any further. My boy was sent to Kalgan for a purpose. Now I
    wouldn't like to let it out, you know, just what the purpose was, naturally, but you look at the
    situation now, and I suppose you can make a pretty good guess. In any case, my boy was the
    man for the job. We Traders needed some sort of ruckus." He smiled, craftily. "It's here. I'm not
    saying how we did it, but - my boy went to Kalgan, and the Mule sent out his ships. My son!"

    Iwo was duly impressed. He grew confidential in his turn, "That's good. You know, they say
    we've got five hundred ships ready to pitch in on our own at the right time. "

    Fran said authoritatively, "More than that, maybe. This is real strategy. This is the kind I like."
    He clawed loudly at the skin of his abdomen. "But don't you forget that the Mule is a smart boy,
    too. What happened at Horleggor worries me."

    "I heard he lost about ten ships."

    "Sure, but he had a hundred more, and the Foundation had to get out. It's all to the good to
    have those tyrants beaten, but not as quickly as all that." He shook his head.

    "The question I ask is where does the Mule get his ships? There's a widespread rumor we're
    making them for him."

    "We? The Traders? Haven has the biggest ship factories anywhere in the independent worlds,
    and we haven't made one for anyone but ourselves. Do you suppose any world is building a
    fleet for the Mule on its own, without taking the precaution of united action? That's a ... a fairy
    tale."

    "Well, where does he get them?"

    And Fran shrugged, "Makes them himself, I suppose. That worries me, too."

    Fran blinked at the sun and curled his toes about the smooth wood of the polished foot-rest.
    Slowly, he fell asleep and the soft burr of his breathing mingled with the insect sibilance.

    Lastly, there were the very few who knew considerable and were not confident at all.

    Such as Randu, who on the fifth day of the all-Trader convention entered the Central Hall and



    found the two men he had asked to be there, waiting for him. The five hundred seats were
    empty - and were going to stay so.

    Randu said quickly, almost before he sat down, "We three represent about half the military
    potential of the Independent Trading Worlds."

    "Yes," said Mangin of Iss, "my colleague and I have already commented upon the fact."

    "I am ready," said Randu, "to speak quickly and earnestly. I am not interested in bargaining or
    subtlety. Our position is radically in the worse."

    "As a result of-" urged Ovall Gri of Mnemon.

    "Of developments of the last hour. Please! From the beginning. First, our position is not of our
    doing, and but doubtfully of our control. Our original dealings were not with the Mule, but with
    several others; notably the ex-warlord of Kalgan, whom the Mule defeated at a most
    inconvenient time for us."

    "Yes, but this Mule is a worthy substitute," said Mangin. "I do not cavil at details."

    "You may when you know all the details." Randu leaned forward and placed his hands upon the
    table palms-up in an obvious gesture.

    Fie said, "A month ago I sent my nephew and my nephew's wife to Kalgan."

    "Your nephew!" cried Ovall Gri, in surprise. "I did not know he was your nephew."

    "With what purpose," asked Mangin, dryly. "This?" And his thumb drew an inclusive circle high
    in the air.

    "No. If you mean the Mule's war on the Foundation, no. Flow could I aim so high? The young
    man knew nothing - neither of our organization nor of our aims. Fie was told I was a minor
    member of an intra-Flaven patriotic society, and his function at Kalgan was nothing but that of
    an amateur observer. My motives were, I must admit, rather obscure. Mainly, I was curious
    about the Mule. Fie is a strange phenomenon - but that's a chewed cud; I'll not go into it.
    Secondly, it would make an interesting and educational training project for a man who had
    experience with the Foundation and the Foundation underground and showed promise of future
    usefulness to us. You see-"

    Ovall's long face fell into vertical lines as he showed his large teeth, "You must have been
    surprised at the outcome, then, since there is not a world among the Traders, I believe, that
    does not know that this nephew of yours abducted a Mule underling in the name of the
    Foundation and furnished the Mule with a casus belli. Galaxy, Randu, you spin romances. I find
    it hard to believe you had no hand in that. Come, it was a skillful job."

    Randu shook his white head, "Not of my doing. Nor, willfully, of my nephew's, who is now held
    prisoner at the Foundation, and may not live to see the completion of this so-skillful job. I have
    just heard from him. The Personal Capsule has been smuggled out somehow, come through
    the war zone, gone to Haven, and traveled from there to here. It has been a month on its
    travels."



    And?-'


    Randu leaned a heavy hand upon the heel of his palm and said, sadly, "I'm afraid we are cast
    for the same role that the onetime warlord of Kalgan played. The Mule is a mutant!"

    There was a momentary qualm; a faint impression of quickened heartbeats. Randu might easily
    have imagined it.

    When Mangin spoke, the evenness of his voice was unchanged, "How do you know?"

    "Only because my nephew says so, but he was on Kalgan.

    "What kind of a mutant? There are all kinds, you know."

    Randu forced the rising impatience down, "All kinds of mutants, yes, Mangin. All kinds! But only
    one kind of Mule. What kind of a mutant would start as an unknown, assemble an army,
    establish, they say, a five-mile asteroid as original base, capture a planet, then a system, then
    a region - and then attack the Foundation, and defeat them at Horleggor. And all in two or
    three years!"

    Ovall Gri shrugged, "So you think he'll beat the Foundation?"

    "I don't know. Suppose he does?"

    "Sorry, I can't go that far. You don't beat the Foundation. Look, there's not a new fact we have
    to go on except for the statements of a ... well, of an inexperienced boy. Suppose we shelve it
    for a while. With all the Mule's victories, we weren't worried until now, and unless he goes a
    good deal further than he has, I see no reason to change that. Yes?"

    Randu frowned and despaired at the cobweb texture of his argument. He said to both, "Have
    we yet made any contact with the Mule?"

    "No," both answered.

    "It's true, though, that we've tried, isn't it? It's true that there's not much purpose to our meeting
    unless we do reach him, isn't it? It's true that so far there's been more drinking than thinking,
    and more wooing than doing - I quote from an editorial in today's Radole Tribune - and all
    because we can't reach the Mule. Gentlemen, we have nearly a thousand ships waiting to be
    thrown into the fight at the proper moment to seize control of the Foundation. I say we should
    change that. I say, throw those thousand onto the board now - against the Mule."

    "You mean for the Tyrant Indbur and the bloodsuckers of the Foundation?" demanded Mangin,
    with quiet venom.

    Randu raised a weary hand, "Spare me the adjectives. Against the Mule, I say, and for
    l-don't-care-who."

    Ovall Gri rose, "Randu, I'll have nothing to do with that, You present it to the full council tonight
    if you particularly hunger for political suicide."

    He left without another word and Mangin followed silently, leaving Randu to drag out a lonely



    hour of endless, insoluble consideration.

    At the full council that night, he said nothing.

    But it was Ovall Gri who pushed into his room the next morning; an Ovall Gri only sketchily
    dressed and who had neither shaved nor combed his hair.

    Randu stared at him over a yet-uncleared breakfast table with an astonishment sufficiently
    open and strenuous to cause him to drop his pipe.

    Ovall said baldly, harshly. "Mnemon has been bombarded from space by treacherous attack."
    Randu's eyes narrowed, "The Foundation?"

    "The Mule!" exploded Ovall. "The Mule!" His words raced, "It was unprovoked and deliberate.
    Most of our fleet had joined the international flotilla. The few left as Home Squadron were
    insufficient and were blown out of the sky. There have been no landings yet, and there may not
    be, for half the attackers are reported destroyed - but it is war - and I have come to ask how
    Haven stands on the matter."

    "Haven, I am sure, will adhere to the spirit of the Charter of Federation. But, you see? He
    attacks us as well."

    "This Mule is a madman. Can he defeat the universe?" He faltered and sat down to seize
    Randu's wrist, "Our few survivors have reported the Mule's poss ... enemy's possession of a
    new weapon. A nuclear-field depressor."

    "A what?"

    Ovall said, "Most of our ships were lost because their nuclear weapons failed them. It could not
    have happened by either accident or sabotage. It must have been a weapon of the Mule. It
    didn't work perfectly; the effect was intermittent; there were ways to neutralize - my dispatches
    are not detailed. But you see that such a tool would change the nature of war and, possibly,
    make our entire fleet obsolete."

    Randu felt an old, old man. His face sagged hopelessly, "I am afraid a monster is grown that
    will devour all of us. Yet we must fight him."


    17. THE VISI-SONOR

    Ebling Mis's house in a not-so-pretentious neighborhood of Terminus City was well known to
    the intelligentsia, literati, and just-plain-well-read of the Foundation. Its notable characteristics
    depended, subjectively, upon the source material that was read. To a thoughtful biographer, it
    was the "symbolization of a retreat from a nonacademic reality," a society columnist gushed
    silkily at its "frightfully masculine atmosphere of careless disorder," a University Ph.D. called it
    brusquely, "bookish, but unorganized," a nonuniversity friend said, "good for a drink anytime
    and you can put your feet on the sofa," and a breezy newsweekly broadcast, that went in for
    color, spoke of the "rocky, down-to-earth, no-nonsense living quarters of blaspheming, Leftish,



    balding Ebling Mis."

    To Bayta, who thought for no audience but herself at the moment, and who had the advantage
    of first-hand information, it was merely sloppy.

    Except for the first few days, her imprisonment had been a light burden. Far lighter, it seemed,
    that this half-hour wait in the psychologist's home - under secret observation, perhaps? She
    had been with Toran then, at least.

    Perhaps she might have grown wearier of the strain, had not Magnifico's long nose drooped in
    a gesture that plainly showed his own far greater tension.

    Magnifico's pipe-stem legs were folded up under a pointed, sagging chin, as if he were trying to
    huddle himself into disappearance, and Bayta's hand went out in a gentle and automatic
    gesture of reassurance. Magnifico winced, then smiled.

    "Surely, my lady, it would seem that even yet my body denies the knowledge of my mind and
    expects of others' hands a blow."

    "There's no need for worry, Magnifico. I'm with you, and I won't let anyone hurt you."

    The clown's eyes sidled towards her, then drew away quickly. "But they kept me away from you
    earlier - and from your kind husband - and, on my word, you may laugh, but I was lonely for
    missing friendship."

    "I wouldn't laugh at that. I was, too."

    The clown brightened, and he hugged his knees closer. He said, "You have not met this man
    who will see us?" It was a cautious question.

    "No. But he is a famous man. I have seen him in the newscasts and heard quite a good deal of
    him. I think he's a good man, Magnifico, who means us no harm."

    "Yes?" The clown stirred uneasily. "That may be, my lady, but he has questioned me before,
    and his manner is of an abruptness and loudness that bequivers me. He is full of strange
    words, so that the answers to his questions could not worm out of my throat. Almost, I might
    believe the romancer who once played on my ignorance with a tale that, at such moments, the
    heart lodged in the windpipe and prevented speech."

    "But it's different now. We're two to his one, and he won't be able to frighten the both of us, will
    he?"

    "No, my lady."

    A door slammed somewheres, and the roaring of a voice entered the house. Just outside the
    room, it coagulated into words with a fierce, "Get the "Ga-LAX-y out of here!" and two
    uniformed guards were momentarily visible through the opening door, in quick retreat.

    Ebling Mis entered frowning, deposited a carefully wrapped bundle on the floor, and
    approached to shake Bayta's hand with careless pressure. Bayta returned it vigorously,
    man-fashion. Mis did a double-take as he turned to the clown, and favored the girl with a longer



    look.

    He said, "Married?"

    "Yes. We went through the legal formalities."

    Mis paused. Then, "Happy about it?"

    "So far."

    Mis shrugged, and turned again to Magnifico. He unwrapped the package, "Know what this is,
    boy?"

    Magnifico fairly hurled himself out of his seat and caught the multi-keyed instrument. He
    fingered the myriad knobby contacts and threw a sudden back somersault of joy, to the
    imminent destruction of the nearby furniture.

    He croaked, "A Visi-Sonor - and of a make to distill joy out of a dead man's heart." His long
    fingers caressed softly and slowly, pressing lightly on contacts with a rippling motion, resting
    momentarily on one key then another - and in the air before them there was a soft glowing
    rosiness, just inside the range of vision.

    Ebling Mis said, "All right, boy, you said you could pound on one of those gadgets, and there's
    your chance. You'd better tune it, though. It's out of a museum." Then, in an aside to Bayta,
    "Near as I can make it, no one on the Foundation can make it talk right."

    He leaned closer and said quickly, "The clown won't talk without you. Will you help?"

    She nodded.

    "Good!" he said. "His state of fear is almost fixed, and I doubt that his mental strength would
    possibly stand a psychic probe. If I'm to get anything out of him otherwise, he's got to feel
    absolutely at ease. You understand?"

    She nodded again.

    "This Visi-Sonor is the first step in the process. He says he can play it; and his reaction now
    makes it pretty certain that it's one of the great joys of his life. So whether the playing is good or
    bad, be interested and appreciative. Then exhibit friendliness and confidence in me. Above all,
    follow my lead in everything." There was a swift glance at Magnifico, huddled in a comer of the
    sofa, making rapid adjustments in the interior of the instrument. He was completely absorbed.

    Mis said in a conversational tone to Bayta, "Ever hear a Visi-Sonor?"

    "Once," said Bayta, equally casually, "at a concert of rare instruments. I wasn't impressed."

    "Well, I doubt that you came across good playing. There are very few really good players. It's
    not so much that it requires physical co-ordination - a multi-bank piano requires more, for
    instance - as a certain type of free-wheeling mentality." In a lower voice, "That's why our living
    skeleton there might be better than we think. More often than not, good players are idiots
    otherwise. It's one of those queer setups that makes psychology interesting."



    He added, in a patent effort to manufacture light conversation, "You know how the beblistered
    thing works? I looked it up for this purpose, and all I've made out so far is that its radiations
    stimulate the optic center of the brain directly, without ever touching the optic nerve. It's actually
    the utilization of a sense never met with in ordinary nature. Remarkable, when you come to
    think of it. What you hear is all right. That's ordinary. Eardrum, cochlea, all that. But - Shh! He's
    ready. Will you kick that switch. It works better in the dark."

    In the darkness, Magnifico was a mere blob, Ebling Mis a heavy-breathing mass. Bayta found
    herself straining her eyes anxiously, and at first with no effect. There was a thin, reedy quaver
    in the air, that wavered raggedly up the scale. It hovered, dropped and caught itself, gained in
    body, and swooped into a booming crash that had the effect of a thunderous split in a veiling
    curtain.

    A little globe of pulsing color grew in rhythmic spurts and burst in midair into formless gouts that
    swirled high and came down as curving streamers in interfacing patterns. They coalesced into
    little spheres, no two alike in color - and Bayta began discovering things.

    She noticed that closing her eyes made the color pattern all the clearer; that each little
    movement of color had its own little pattern of sound; that she could not identify the colors; and,
    lastly, that the globes were not globes but little figures.

    Little figures; little shifting flames, that danced and flickered in their myriads; that dropped out of
    sight and returned from nowhere; that whipped about one another and coalesced then into a
    new color.

    Incongruously, Bayta thought of the little blobs of color that come at night when you close your
    eyelids till they hurt, and stare patiently. There was the old familiar effect of the marching polka
    dots of shifting color, of the contracting concentric circles, of the shapeless masses that quiver
    momentarily. All that, larger, multivaried - and each little dot of color a tiny figure.

    They darted at her in pairs, and she lifted her hands with a sudden gasp, but they tumbled and
    for an instant she was the center of a brilliant snowstorm, while cold light slipped off her
    shoulders and down her arm in a luminous ski-slide, shooting off her stiff fingers and meeting
    slowly in a shining midair focus. Beneath it all, the sound of a hundred instruments flowed in
    liquid streams until she could not tell it from the light.

    She wondered if Ebling Mis were seeing the same thing, and if not, what he did see, The
    wonder passed, and then-

    She was watching again. The little figures-were they little figures? -little tiny women with
    burning hair that turned and bent too quickly for the mind to focus? -seized one another in
    star-shaped groups that turned - and the music was faint laughter - girls' laughter that began
    inside the ear.

    The stars drew together, sparked towards one another, grew slowly into structure - and from
    below, a palace shot upward in rapid evolution. Each brick a tiny color, each color a tiny spark,
    each spark a stabbing light that shifted patterns and led the eye skyward to twenty jeweled
    minarets.



    A glittering carpet shot out and about, whirling, spinning an insubstantial web that engulfed all
    space, and from it luminous shoots stabbed upward and branched into trees that sang with a
    music all their own.

    Bayta sat inclosed in it. The music welled about her in rapid, lyrical flights. She reached out to
    touch a fragile tree and blossoming spicules floated downwards and faded, each with its clear,
    tiny tinkle.

    The music crashed in twenty cymbals, and before her an area flamed up in a spout and
    cascaded down invisible steps into Bayta's lap, where it spilled over and flowed in rapid current,
    raising the fiery sparkle to her waist, while across her lap was a rainbow bridge and upon it the
    little figures-

    A palace, and a garden, and tiny men and women on a bridge, stretching out as far as she
    could see, swimming through the stately swells of stringed music converging in upon her-

    And then - there seemed a frightened pause, a hesitant, indrawn motion, a swift collapse. The
    colors fled, spun into a globe that shrank, and rose, and disappeared.

    And it was merely dark again.

    A heavy foot scratched for the pedal, reached it, and the light flooded in; the flat light of a prosy
    sun. Bayta blinked until the tears came, as though for the longing of what was gone. Ebling Mis
    was a podgy inertness with his eyes still round and his mouth still open.

    Only Magnifico himself was alive, and he fondled his Visi-Sonor in a crooning ecstasy.

    "My lady," he gasped, "it is indeed of an effect the most magical. It is of balance and response
    almost beyond hope in its delicacy and stability. On this, it would seem I could work wonders.
    How liked you my composition, my lady?"

    "Was it yours?" breathed Bayta. "Your own?"

    At her awe, his thin face turned a glowing red to the tip of his mighty nose. "My very own, my
    lady. The Mule liked it not, but often and often I have played it for my own amusement. It was
    once, in my youth, that I saw the palace - a gigantic place of jeweled riches that I saw from a
    distance at a time of high carnival. There were people of a splendor undreamed of - and
    magnificence more than ever I saw afterwards, even in the Mule's service. It is but a poor
    makeshift I have created, but my mind's poverty precludes more. I call it, 'The Memory of
    Heaven.'"

    Now through the midst of the chatter, Mis shook himself to active life. "Here," he said, "here,
    Magnifico, would you like to do that same thing for others?"

    For a moment, the clown drew back. "For others?" he quavered.

    "For thousands," cried Mis, "in the great Halls of the Foundation. Would you like to be your own
    master, and honored by all, wealthy, and ... and-" his imagination failed him. "And all that? Eh?
    What do you say?"

    "But how may I be all that, mighty sir, for indeed I am but a poor clown ungiven to the great



    things of the world?"

    The psychologist puffed out his lips, and passed the back of his hand across his brow. He said,
    "But your playing, man. The world is yours if you would play so for the mayor and his Trading
    Trusts. Wouldn't you like that?"

    The clown glanced briefly at Bayta, "Would she stay with me?"

    Bayta laughed, "Of course, silly. Would it be likely that I'd leave you now that you're on the point
    of becoming rich and famous?"

    "It would all be yours," he replied earnestly, "and surely the wealth of Galaxy itself would be
    yours before I could repay my debt to your kindness."

    "But," said Mis, casually, "if you would first help me-"

    "What is that?"

    The psychologist paused, and smiled, "A little surface probe that doesn't hurt. It wouldn't touch
    but the peel of your brain."

    There was a flare of deadly fear in Magnifico's eyes. "Not a probe. I have seen it used. It drains
    the mind and leaves an empty skull. The Mule did use it upon traitors and let them wander
    mindless through the streets, until out of mercy, they were killed." He held up his hand to push
    Mis away.

    "That was a psychic probe," explained Mis, patiently, "and even that would only harm a person
    when misused. This probe I have is a surface probe that wouldn't hurt a baby. "

    "That's right, Magnifico," urged Bayta. "It's only to help beat the Mule and keep him far away.
    Once that's done, you and I will be rich and famous all our lives."

    Magnifico held out a trembling hand, "Will you hold my hand, then?"

    Bayta took it in both her own, and the clown watched the approach of the burnished terminal
    plates with large eyes.

    Ebling Mis rested carelessly on the too-lavish chair in Mayor Indbur's private quarters,
    unregenerately unthankful for the condescension shown him and watched the small mayor's
    fidgeting unsympathetically. He tossed away a cigar stub and spat out a shred of tobacco.

    "And, incidentally, if you want something for your next concert at Mallow Hall, Indbur," he said,
    "you can dump out those electronic gadgeteers into the sewers they came from and have this
    little freak play the Visi-Sonor for you. Indbur - it's out of this world."

    Indbur said peevishly, "I did not call you here to listen to your lectures on music. What of the
    Mule? Tell me that. What of the Mule?"

    "The Mule? Well, I'll tell you - I used a surface probe and got little. Can't use the psychic probe
    because the freak is scared blind of it, so that his resistance will probably blow his unprintable
    mental fuses as soon as contact is made. But this is what I've got, if you'll just stop tapping your



    fingernails—

    "First place, de-stress the Mule's physical strength. He's probably strong, but most of the freak's
    fairy tales about it are probably considerably blown up by his own fearful memory, He wears
    queer glasses and his eyes kill, he evidently has mental powers."

    "So much we had at the start," commented the mayor, sourly.

    "Then the probe confirms it, and from there on I've been working mathematically."

    "So? And how long will all this take? Your word-rattling will deafen me yet."

    "About a month, I should say, and I may have something for you. And I may not, of course. But
    what of it? If this is all outside Seldon's plans, our chances are precious little, unprintable little."

    Indbur whirled on the psychologist fiercely, "Now I have you, traitor. Lie! Say you're not one of
    these criminal rumormongers that are spreading defeatism and panic through the Foundation,
    and making my work doubly hard."

    "I? I?" Mis gathered anger slowly.

    Indbur swore at him, "Because by the dust-clouds of space, the Foundation will win - the
    Foundation must win."

    "Despite the loss at Horleggor?"

    "It was not a loss. You have swallowed that spreading lie, too? We were outnumbered and
    betreasoned-"

    "By whom?" demanded Mis, contemptuously.

    "By the lice-ridden democrats of the gutter," shouted Indbur back at him. "I have known for long
    that the fleet has been riddled by democratic cells. Most have been wiped out, but enough
    remain for the unexplained surrender of twenty ships in the thickest of the swarming fight.
    Enough to force an apparent defeat.

    "For that matter, my rough-tongued, simple patriot and epitome of the primitive virtues, what are
    your own connections with the democrats?"

    Ebling Mis shrugged it off, "You rave, do you know that? What of the retreat since, and the loss
    of half of Siwenna? Democrats again?"

    "No. Not democrats," the little man smiled sharply. "We retreat - as the Foundation has always
    retreated under attack, until the inevitable march of history turns with us. Already, I see the
    outcome. Already, the so-called underground of the democrats has issued manifestoes
    swearing aid and allegiance to the Government. It could be a feint, a cover for a deeper
    treachery, but I make good use of it, and the propaganda distilled from it will have its effect,
    whatever the crawling traitors scheme. And better than that-"

    "Even better than that, Indbur?"

    "Judge for yourself. Two days ago, the so-called Association of Independent Traders declared



    war on the Mule, and the Foundation fleet is strengthened, at a stroke, by a thousand ships.
    You see, this Mule goes too far. He finds us divided and quarreling among ourselves and under
    the pressure of his attack we unite and grow strong. He must lose. It is inevitable - as always."

    Mis still exuded skepticism, "Then you tell me that Seldon planned even for the fortuitous
    occurrence of a mutant."

    "A mutant! I can't tell him from a human, nor could you but for the ravings of a rebel captain,
    some outland youngsters, and an addled juggler and clown. You forget the most conclusive
    evidence of all - your own."

    "My own?" For just a moment, Mis was startled.

    "Your own," sneered the mayor. "The Time Vault opens in nine weeks. What of that? It opens
    for a crisis. If this attack of the Mule is not the crisis, where is the 'real' one, the one the Vault is
    opening for? Answer me, you lardish ball."

    The psychologist shrugged, "All tight. If it keeps you happy. Do me a favor, though. Just in case
    ... just in case old Seldon makes his speech and it does go sour, suppose you let me attend the
    Grand Opening."

    "All right. Get out of here. And stay out of my sight for nine weeks."

    "With unprintable pleasure, you wizened horror," muttered Mis to himself as he left.


    18. FALL OF THE FOUNDATION

    There was an atmosphere about the Time Vault that just missed definition in several directions
    at once. It was not one of decay, for it was well-lit and well-conditioned, with the color scheme
    of the walls lively, and the rows of fixed chairs comfortable and apparently designed for eternal
    use. It was not even ancient, for three centuries had left no obvious mark. There was certainly
    no effort at the creation of awe or reverence, for the appointments were simple and everyday -
    next door to bareness, in fact.

    Yet after all the negatives were added and the sum disposed of, something was left - and that
    something centered about the glass cubicle that dominated half the room with its clear
    emptiness. Four times in three centuries, the living simulacrum of Hari Seldon himself had sat
    there and spoken. Twice he had spoken to no audience.

    Through three centuries and nine generations, the old man who had seen the great days of
    universal empire projected himself - and still he understood more of the Galaxy of his
    great-ultra-great-grandchildren, than did those grandchildren themselves.

    Patiently that empty cubicle waited.

    The first to arrive was Mayor Indbur III, driving his ceremonial ground car through the hushed
    and anxious streets. Arriving with him was his own chair, higher than those that belonged there,
    and wider. It was placed before all the others, and Indbur dominated all but the empty



    glassiness before him.

    The solemn official at his left bowed a reverent head. "Excellence, arrangements are completed
    for the widest possible sub-etheric spread for the official announcement by your excellence
    tonight."

    "Good. Meanwhile, special interplanetary programs concerning the Time Vault are to continue.
    There will, of course, be no predictions or speculations of any sort on the subject. Does popular
    reaction continue satisfactory?"

    "Excellence, very much so. The vicious rumors prevailing of late have decreased further.
    Confidence is widespread."

    "Good!" He gestured the man away and adjusted his elaborate neckpiece to a nicety.

    It was twenty minutes of noon!

    A select group of the great props of the mayoralty - the leaders of the great Trading
    organizations - appeared in ones and twos with the degree of pomp appropriate to their
    financial status and place in mayoral favor. Each presented himself to the mayor, received a
    gracious word or two, took an assigned seat.

    Somewhere, incongruous among the stilted ceremony of all this, Randu of Haven made his
    appearance and wormed his way unannounced to the mayor's seat.

    "Excellence!" he muttered, and bowed.

    Indbur frowned. "You have not been granted an audience. "

    "Excellence, I have requested one for a week."

    "I regret that the matters of State involved in the appearance of Seldon have-"

    "Excellence, I regret them, too, but I must ask you to rescind your order that the ships of the
    Independent Traders be distributed among the fleets of the Foundation."

    Indbur had flushed red at the interruption. "This is not the time for discussion."

    "Excellence, it is the only time," Randu whispered urgently. "As representative of the
    Independent Trading Worlds, I tell you such a move can not be obeyed. It must be rescinded
    before Seldon solves our problem for us. Once the emergency is passed, it will be too late to
    conciliate and our alliance will melt away."

    Indbur stared at Randu coldly. "You realize that I am head of the Foundation armed forces?
    Have I the right to determine military policy or have I not?"

    "Excellence, you have, but some things are inexpedient."

    "I recognize no inexpediency. It is dangerous to allow your people separate fleets in this
    emergency. Divided action plays into the hands of the enemy. We must unite, ambassador,
    militarily as well as politically."



    Randu felt his throat muscles tighten. He omitted the courtesy of the opening title. "You feet
    safe now that Seldon will speak, and you move against us. A month ago you were soft and
    yielding, when our ships defeated the Mule at Terel. I might remind you, sir, that it is the
    Foundation Fleet that has been defeated in open battle five times, and that the ships of the
    Independent Trading Worlds have won your victories for you."

    Indbur frowned dangerously, "You are no longer welcome upon Terminus, ambassador. Your
    return will be requested this evening. Furthermore, your connection with subversive democratic
    forces on Terminus will be - and has been - investigated."

    Randu replied, "When I leave, our ships will go with me. I know nothing of your democrats. I
    know only that your Foundation's ships have surrendered to the Mule by the treason of their
    high officers, not their sailors, democratic or otherwise. I tell you that twenty ships of the
    Foundation surrendered at Horleggor at the orders of their rear admiral, when they were
    unharmed and unbeaten. The rear admiral was your own close associate - he presided at the
    trial of my nephew when he first arrived from Kalgan. It is not the only case we know of and our
    ships and men will not be risked under potential traitors.

    Indbur said, "You will be placed under guard upon leaving here."

    Randu walked away under the silent stares of the contemptuous coterie of the rulers of
    Terminus.

    It was ten minutes of twelve!

    Bayta and Toran had already arrived. They rose in their back seats and beckoned to Randu as
    he passed.

    Randu smiled gently, "You are here after all. How did you work it?"

    "Magnifico was our politician," grinned Toran. "Indbur insists upon his Visi-Sonor composition
    based on the Time Vault, with himself, no doubt, as hero. Magnifico refused to attend without
    us, and there was no arguing him out of it. Ebling Mis is with us, or was. He's wandering about
    somewhere." Then, with a sudden access of anxious qravity, "Why, what's wronq, uncle? You
    don't look well."

    Randu nodded, "I suppose not. We're in for bad times, Toran. When the Mule is disposed of,
    our turn will come, I'm afraid. "

    A straight solemn figure in white approached, and greeted them with a stiff bow.

    Bayta's dark eyes smiled, as she held out her hand, "Captain Pritcher! Are you on space duty
    then?"

    The captain took the hand and bowed lower, "Nothing like it. Dr. Mis, I understand, has been
    instrumental in bringing me here, but it's only temporary. Back to home guard tomorrow. What
    time is it?"

    It was three minutes of twelve!

    Magnifico was the picture of misery and heartsick depression. His body curled up, in his eternal



    effort at self-effacement. His long nose was pinched at the nostrils and his large, down-slanted
    eyes darted uneasily about.

    He clutched at Bayta's hand, and when she bent down, he whispered, "Do you suppose, my
    lady, that all these great ones were in the audience, perhaps, when I ... when I played the
    Visi-Sonor?"

    "Everyone, I'm sure," Bayta assured him, and shook him gently. "And I'm sure they all think
    you're the most wonderful player in the Galaxy and that your concert was the greatest ever
    seen, so you just straighten yourself and sit correctly. We must have dignity."

    He smiled feebly at her mock-frown and unfolded his long-boned limbs slowly.

    It was noon - and the glass cubicle was no longer empty.

    It was doubtful that anyone had witnessed the appearance. It was a clean break; one moment
    not there and the next moment there.

    In the cubicle was a figure in a wheelchair, old and shrunken, from whose wrinkled face bright
    eyes shone, and whose voice, as it turned out, was the livest thing about him. A book lay face
    downward in his lap, and the voice came softly.

    "I am Hari Seldon!"

    He spoke through a silence, thunderous in its intensity.

    "I am Hari Seldon! I do not know if anyone is here at all by mere sense-perception but that is
    unimportant. I have few fears as yet of a breakdown in the Plan. For the first three centuries the
    percentage probability of nondeviation is nine-four point two."

    He paused to smile, and then said genially, "By the way, if any of you are standing, you may sit.
    If any would like to smoke, please do. I am not here in the flesh. I require no ceremony.

    "Let us take up the problem of the moment, then. For the first time, the Foundation has been
    faced, or perhaps, is in the last stages of facing, civil war. Till now, the attacks from without
    have been adequately beaten off, and inevitably so, according to the strict laws of
    psychohistory. The attack at present is that of a too-undisciplined outer group of the Foundation
    against the too-authoritarian central government. The procedure was necessary, the result
    obvious."

    The dignity of the high-born audience was beginning to break. Indbur was half out of his chair.

    Bayta leaned forward with troubled eyes. What was the great Seldon talking about? She had
    missed a few of the words-

    "-that the compromise worked out is necessary in two respects. The revolt of the Independent
    Traders introduces an element of new uncertainty in a government perhaps grown
    over-confident. The element of striving is restored. Although beaten, a healthy increase of
    democracy-"

    There were raised voices now. Whispers had ascended the scale of loudness, and the edge of



    panic was in them.

    Bayta said in Toran's ear, "Why doesn't he talk about the Mule? The Traders never revolted."
    Toran shrugged his shoulders.

    The seated figure spoke cheerfully across and through the increasing disorganization:

    "-a new and firmer coalition government was the necessary and beneficial outcome of the
    logical civil war forced upon the Foundation. And now only the remnants of the old Empire
    stand in the way of further expansion, and in them, for the next few years, at any rate, is no
    problem. Of course, I can not reveal the nature of the next prob-"

    In the complete uproar, Seldon's lips moved soundlessly.

    Ebling Mis was next to Randu, face ruddy. He was shouting. "Seldon is off his rocker. He's got
    the wrong crisis. Were your Traders ever planning civil war?"

    Randu said thinly, "We planned one, yes. We called it off in the face of the Mule."

    "Then the Mule is an added feature, unprepared for in Seldon's psychohistory. Now what's
    happened?"

    In the sudden, frozen silence, Bayta found the cubicle once again empty. The nuclear glow of
    the walls was dead, the soft current of conditioned air absent.

    Somewhere the sound of a shrill siren was rising and falling in the scale and Randu formed the
    words with his lips, "Space raid!"

    And Ebling Mis held his wrist watch to his ears and shouted suddenly, "Stopped, by the
    "Ga-LAX-y, is there a watch in the room that is going?" His voice was a roar.

    Twenty wrists went to twenty ears. And in far less than twenty seconds, it was quite certain that
    none were.

    "Then," said Mis, with a grim and horrible finality, "something has stopped all nuclear power in
    the Time Vault - and the Mule is attacking."

    Indbur's wail rose high above the noise, "Take your seats! The Mule is fifty parsecs distant."

    "He was," shouted back Mis, "a week ago. Right now, Terminus is being bombarded."

    Bayta felt a deep depression settle softly upon her. She felt its folds tighten close and thick,
    until her breath forced its way only with pain past her tightened throat.

    The outer noise of a gathering crowd was evident. The doors were thrown open and a harried
    figure entered, and spoke rapidly to Indbur, who had rushed to him.

    "Excellence," he whispered, "not a vehicle is running in the city, not a communication line to the
    outside is open.

    The Tenth Fleet is reported defeated and the Mule's ships are outside the atmosphere. The
    general staff-"



    Indbur crumpled, and was a collapsed figure of impotence upon the floor. In all that hall, not a
    voice was raised now. Even the growing crowd without was fearful, but silent, and the horror of
    cold panic hovered dangerously.

    Indbur was raised. Wine was held to his lips. His lips moved before his eyes opened, and the
    word they formed was, "Surrender!"

    Bayta found herself near to crying - not for sorrow or humiliation, but simply and plainly out of a
    vast frightened despair. Ebling Mis plucked at her sleeve. "Come, young lady-"

    She was pulled out of her chair, bodily.

    "We're leaving," he said, "and take your musician with you." The plump scientist's lips were
    trembling and colorless.

    "Magnifico," said Bayta, faintly. The clown shrank in horror. His eyes were glassy.

    "The Mule," he shrieked. "The Mule is coming for me."

    He thrashed wildly at her touch. Toran leaned over and brought his fist up sharply. Magnifico
    slumped into unconsciousness and Toran carried him out potato-sack fashion.

    The next day, the ugly, battle-black ships of the Mule poured down upon the landing fields of
    the planet Terminus. The attacking general sped down the empty main street of Terminus City
    in a foreign-made ground car that ran where a whole city of atomic cars still stood useless.

    The proclamation of occupation was made twenty-four hours to the minute after Seldon had
    appeared before the former mighty of the Foundation.

    Of all the Foundation planets, only the Independent Traders still stood, and against them the
    power of the Mule - conqueror of the Foundation - now turned itself.


    19. START OF THE SEARCH

    The lonely planet, Haven - only planet of an only sun of a Galactic Sector that trailed raggedly
    off into intergalactic vacuum - was under siege.

    In a strictly military sense, it was certainly under siege, since no area of space on the Galactic
    side further than twenty parsecs distance was outside range of the Mule's advance bases. In
    the four months since the shattering fall of the Foundation, Haven's communications had fallen
    apart like a spiderweb under the razor's edge. The ships of Haven converged inwards upon the
    home world, and only Haven itself was now a fighting base.

    And in other respects, the siege was even closer; for the shrouds of helplessness and doom
    had already invaded

    Bayta plodded her way down the pink-waved aisle past the rows of milky plastic-topped tables
    and found her seat by blind reckoning. She eased on to the high, armless chair, answered
    half-heard greetings mechanically, rubbed a wearily-itching eye with the back of a weary hand,



    and reached for her menu.


    She had time to register a violent mental reaction of distaste to the pronounced presence of
    various cultured-fungus dishes, which were considered high delicacies at Haven, and which her
    Foundation taste found highly inedible - and then she was aware of the sobbing near her and
    looked up.

    Until then, her notice of Juddee, the plain, snub-nosed, indifferent blonde at the dining unit
    diagonally across had been the superficial one of the nonacquaintance. And now Juddee was
    crying, biting woefully at a moist handkerchief, and choking back sobs until her complexion was
    blotched with turgid red. Her shapeless radiation-proof costume was thrown back upon her
    shoulders, and her transparent face shield had tumbled forward into her dessert, and there
    remained.

    Bayta joined the three girls who were taking turns at the eternally applied and eternally
    inefficacious remedies of shoulder-patting, hair-smoothing, and incoherent murmuring.

    "What's the matter?" she whispered.

    One turned to her and shrugged a discreet, "I don't know." Then, feeling the inadequacy of the
    gesture, she pulled Bayta aside.

    "She's had a hard day, I guess. And she's worrying about her husband."

    "Is he on space patrol?"

    "Yes".

    Bayta reached a friendly hand out to Juddee.

    "Why don't you go home, Juddee?" Her voice was a cheerfully businesslike intrusion on the
    soft, flabby inanities that had preceded.

    Juddee looked up half in resentment. "I've been out once this week already-"

    "Then you'll be out twice. If you try to stay on, you know, you'll just be out three days next week
    - so going home now amounts to patriotism. Any of you girls work in her department? Well,
    then, suppose you take care of her card. Better go to the washroom first, Juddee, and get the
    peaches and cream back where it belongs. Go ahead! Shoo!"

    Bayta returned to her seat and took up the menu again with a dismal relief. These moods were
    contagious. One weeping girl would have her entire department in a frenzy these nerve-torn
    days.

    She made a distasteful decision, pressed the correct buttons at her elbow and put the menu
    back into its niche.

    The tall, dark girl opposite her was saying, "Isn't much any of us can do except cry, is there?"

    Her amazingly full lips scarcely moved, and Bayta noticed that their ends were carefully
    touched to exhibit that artificial, just-so half-smile that was the current last word in
    sophistication.



    Bayta investigated the insinuating thrust contained in the words with lashed eyes and
    welcomed the diversion of the arrival of her lunch, as the tile-top of her unit moved inward and
    the food lifted. She tore the wrappings carefully off her cutlery and handled them gingerly till
    they cooled.

    She said, "Can't you think of anything else to do, Hella?"

    "Oh, yes," said Hella. "/can!" She flicked her cigarette with a casual and expert finger-motion
    into the little recess provided and the tiny flash caught it before it hit shallow bottom.

    "For instance," and Hella clasped slender, well-kept hands under her chin, "I think we could
    make a very nice arrangement with the Mule and stop all this nonsense. But then I don't have
    the ... uh ... facilities to manage to get out of places quickly when the Mule takes over."

    Bayta's clear forehead remained clear. Her voice was light and indifferent. "You don't happen to
    have a brother or husband in the fighting ships, do you?"

    "No. All the more credit that I see no reason for the sacrifice of the brothers and husbands of
    others."

    "The sacrifice will come the more surely for surrender."

    "The Foundation surrendered and is at peace. Our men are away and the Galaxy is against
    us."

    Bayta shrugged, and said sweetly, "I'm afraid it is the first of the pair that bothers you." She
    returned to her vegetable platter and ate it with the clammy realization of the silence about her.
    No one in ear-shot had cared to answer Hella's cynicism.

    She left quickly, after stabbing at the button which cleared her dining unit for the next shift's
    occupant.

    A new girl, three seats away, stage-whispered to Hella, "Who was she?"

    Hella's mobile lips curled in indifference. "She's our coordinator's niece. Didn't you know that?"

    "Yes?" Her eyes sought out the last glimpse of disappearing back. "What's she doing here?"

    "Just an assembly girl. Don't you know it's fashionable to be patriotic? It's all so democratic, it
    makes me retch."

    "Now, Hella," said the plump girl to her right. "She's never pulled her uncle on us yet. Why don't
    you lay off?"

    Hella ignored her neighbor with a glazed sweep of eyes and lit another cigarette.

    The new girl was listening to the chatter of the bright-eyed accountant opposite. The words
    were coming quickly,

    "-and she's supposed to have been in the Vault - actually in the Vault, you know - when
    Seldon spoke - and they say the mayor was in frothing furies and there were riots, and all of
    that sort of thing, you know. She got away before the Mule landed, and they say she had the



    most tha-rilling escape - had to go through the blockade, and all - and I do wonder she doesn't
    write a book about it, these war books being so popular these days, you know. And she was
    supposed to be on this world of the Mule's, too - Kalgan, you know - and-"

    The time bell shrilled and the dining room emptied slowly. The accountant's voice buzzed on,
    and the new girl interrupted only with the conventional and wide-eyed, "Really-y-y-y?" at
    appropriate points.

    The huge cave lights were being shielded group-wise in the gradual descent towards the
    darkness that meant sleep for the righteous and hard-working, when Bayta returned home.

    Toran met her at the door, with a slice of buttered bread in his hand.

    "Where've you been?" he asked, food-muffled. Then, more clearly, "I've got a dinner of sorts
    rassled up. If it isn't much, don't blame me."

    But she was circling him, wide-eyed. "Torie! Where's your uniform? What are you doing in
    civvies?"

    "Orders, Bay. Randu is holed up with Ebling Mis right now, and what it's all about, I don't know.
    So there you have everything."

    "Am I going?" She moved towards him impulsively.

    He kissed her before he answered, "I believe so. It will probably be dangerous."

    "What isn't dangerous?"

    "Exactly. Oh, yes, and I've already sent for Magnifico, so he's probably coming too."

    "You mean his concert at the Engine Factory will have to be cancelled."

    "Obviously."

    Bayta passed into the next room and sat down to a meal that definitely bore signs of having
    been "rassled-up." She cut the sandwiches in two with quick efficiency and said:

    "That's too bad about the concert. The girls at the factory were looking forward to it. Magnifico,
    too, for that matter." She shook her head. "He's such a queer thing."

    "Stirs your mother-complex, Bay, that's what he does. Some day we'll have a baby, and then
    you'll forget Magnifico."

    'Bayta answered from the depths of her sandwich, "Strikes me that you're all the stirring my
    mother-complex can stand."

    And then she laid the sandwich down, and was gravely serious in a moment.

    "Torie."

    "M-m-m?"

    "Torie, I was at City Hall today - at the Bureau of Production. That is why I was so late today."



    "What were you doing there?"

    "Well..." she hesitated, uncertainly. "It's been building up. I was getting so I couldn't stand it at
    the factory. Morale just doesn't exist. The girls go on crying jags for no particular reason. Those
    who don't get sick become sullen. Even the little mousie types pout. In my particular section,
    production isn't a quarter what it was when I came, and there isn't a day that we have a full
    roster of workers."

    "All right," said Toran, "tie in the B. of P. What did you do there?"

    "Asked a few questions. And it's so, Torie, it's so all over Haven. Dropping production,
    increasing sedition and disaffection. The bureau chief just shrugged his shoulders - after I had
    sat in the anteroom an hour to see him, and only got in because I was the co-ordinator's niece
    - and said it was beyond him. Frankly, I don't think he cared."

    "Now, don't go off base, Bay."

    "I don't think he did." She was strenuously fiery. "I tell you there's something wrong. It's that
    same horrible frustration that hit me in the Time Vault when Seldon deserted us. You felt it
    yourself."

    "Yes, I did."

    "Well, it's back," she continued savagely. "And we'll never be able to resist the Mule. Even if we
    had the material, we lack the heart, the spirit, the will - Torie, there's no use fighting-"

    Bayta had never cried in Toran's memory, and she did not cry now. Not really. But Toran laid a
    light hand on her shoulder and whispered, "Suppose you forget it, baby. I know what you mean.
    But there's nothing-"

    "Yes, there's nothing we can do! Everyone says that - and we just sit and wait for the knife to
    come down."

    She returned to what was left of her sandwich and tea. Quietly, Toran was arranging the beds.

    It was quite dark outside.

    Randu, as newly-appointed co-ordinator - in itself a wartime post - of the confederation of
    cities on Haven, had been assigned, at his own request, to an upper room, out of the window of
    which he could brood over the roof tops and greenery of the city. Now, in the fading of the cave
    lights, the city receded into the level lack of distinction of the shades. Randu did not care to
    meditate upon the symbolism.

    He said to Ebling Mis - whose clear, little eyes seemed to have no further interest than the
    red-filled goblet in his hand - "There's a saying on Haven that when the cave lights go out, it is
    time for the righteous and hard-working to sleep."

    "Do you sleep much lately?"

    "No! Sorry to call you so late, Mis. I like the night better somehow these days. Isn't that
    strange? The people on Haven condition themselves pretty strictly on the lack of light meaning
    sleep. Myself, too. But it's different now-"



    "You're hiding," said Mis, flatly. "You're surrounded by people in the waking period, and you feel
    their eyes and their hopes on you. You can't stand up under it. In the sleep period, you're free."

    "Do you feel it, too, then? This miserable sense of defeat?"

    Ebling Mis nodded slowly, "I do. It's a mass psychosis, an unprintable mob panic. "Ga-LAX-y,
    Randu, what do you expect? Here you have a whole culture brought up to a blind, blubbering
    belief that a folk hero of the past has everything all planned out and is taking care of every little
    piece of their unprintable lives. The thought-pattern evoked has religious characteristics, and
    you know what that means."

    "Not a bit."

    Mis was not enthusiastic about the necessity of explanation. He never was. So he growled,
    stared at the long cigar he rolled thoughtfully between his fingers and said, "Characterized by
    strong faith reactions. Beliefs can't be shaken short of a major shock, in which case, a fairly
    complete mental disruption results. Mild cases-hysteria, morbid sense of insecurity. Advanced
    cases - madness and suicide."

    Randu bit at a thumbnail. "When Seldon fails us, in other words, our prop disappears, and
    we've been leaning upon it so long, our muscles are atrophied to where we can not stand
    without it."

    "That's it. Sort of a clumsy metaphor, but that's it."

    "And you, Ebling, what of your own muscles?"

    The psychologist filtered a long draught of air through his cigar, and let the smoke laze out.
    "Rusty, but not atrophied. My profession has resulted in just a bit of independent thinking."

    "And you see a way out?"

    "No, but there must be one. Maybe Seldon made no provisions for the Mule. Maybe he didn't
    guarantee our victory. But, then, neither did he guarantee defeat. He's just out of the game and
    we're on our own. The Mule can be licked."

    "How?"

    "By the only way anyone can be licked - by attacking in strength at weakness. See here,

    Randu, the Mule isn't a superman. If he is finally defeated, everyone will see that for himself.

    It's just that he's an unknown, and the legends cluster quickly. He's supposed to be a mutant.
    Well, what of that? A mutant means a 'superman' to the ignoramuses of humanity. Nothing of
    the sort.

    "It's been estimated that several million mutants are born in the Galaxy every day. Of the
    several million, all but one or two percent can be detected only by means of microscopes and
    chemistry. Of the one or two percent macromutants, that is, those with mutations detectable to
    the naked eye or naked mind, all but one or two percent are freaks, fit for the amusement
    centers, the laboratories, and death. Of the few macromutants whose differences are to the
    good, almost all are harmless curiosities, unusual in some single respect, normal - and often



    subnormal - in most others. You see that, Randu?"

    "I do. But what of the Mule?"

    "Supposing the Mule to be a mutant then, we can assume that he has some attribute,
    undoubtedly mental, which can be used to conquer worlds. In other respects, he undoubtedly
    has his shortcomings, which we must locate. He would not be so secretive, so shy of others'
    eyes, if these shortcomings were not apparent and fatal. If he's a mutant."

    "Is there an alternative?"

    "There might be. Evidence for mutation rests on Captain Han Pritcher of what used to be
    Foundation's Intelligence. He drew his conclusions from the feeble memories of those who
    claimed to know the Mule-or somebody who might have been the Mule - in infancy and early
    childhood. Pritcher worked on slim pickings there, and what evidence he found might easily
    have been planted by the Mule for his own purposes, for it's certain that the Mule has been
    vastly aided by his reputation as a mutant-superman."

    "This is interesting. How long have you thought that?"

    "I never thought that, in the sense of believing it. It is merely an alternative to be considered.

    For instance, Randu, suppose the Mule has discovered a form of radiation capable of
    depressing mental energy just as he is in possession of one which depresses nuclear
    reactions. What then, eh? Could that explain what's hitting us now - and what did hit the
    Foundation?"

    Randu seemed immersed in a near-wordless gloom.

    He said, "What of your own researches on the Mule's clown."

    And now Ebling Mis hesitated. "Useless as yet. I spoke bravely to the mayor previous to the
    Foundation's collapse, mainly to keep his courage up - partly to keep my own up as well. But,
    Randu, if my mathematical tools were up to it, then from the clown alone I could analyze the
    Mule completely. Then we would have him. Then we could solve the queer anomalies that have
    impressed me already."

    "Such as?"

    "Think, man. The Mule defeated the navies of the Foundation at will, but he has not once
    managed to force the much weaker fleets of the Independent Traders to retreat in open
    combat. The Foundation fell at a blow; the Independent Traders hold out against all his
    strength. He first used Extinguishing Field upon the nuclear weapons of the Independent
    Traders of Mnemon. The element of surprise lost them that battle but they countered the Field.
    He was never able to use it successfully against the Independents again.

    "But over and over again, it worked against Foundation forces. It worked on the Foundation
    itself. Why? With our present knowledge, it is all illogical. So there must be factors of which we
    are not aware."


    Treachery?



    "That's rattle-pated nonsense, Randu. Unprintable twaddle. There wasn't a man on the
    Foundation who wasn't sure of victory. Who would betray a certain-to-win side."

    Randu stepped to the curved window and stared unseeingly out into the unseeable. He said,
    "But we're certain to lose now, if the Mule had a thousand weaknesses; if he were a network of
    holes-"

    He did not turn. It was as if the slump of his back, the nervous groping for one another of the
    hands behind him that spoke. He said, "We escaped easily after the Time Vault episode,

    Ebling. Others might have escaped as well. A few did. Most did not. The Extinguishing Field
    could have been counteracted. It asked ingenuity and a certain amount of labor. All the ships of
    the Foundation Navy could have flown to Haven or other nearby planets to continue the fight as
    we did. Not one percent did so. In effect, they deserted to the enemy.

    "The Foundation underground, upon which most people here seem to rely so heavily, has thus
    far done nothing of consequence. The Mule has been politic enough to promise to safeguard
    the property and profits of the great Traders and they have gone over to him."

    Ebling Mis said stubbornly, "The plutocrats have always been against us."

    "They always held the power, too. Listen, Ebling. We have reason to believe that the Mule or
    his tools have already been in contact with powerful men among the Independent Traders. At
    least ten of the twenty-seven Trading Worlds are known to have gone over to the Mule.

    Perhaps ten more waver. There are personalities on Haven itself who would not be unhappy
    over the Mule's domination. It's apparently an insurmountable temptation to give up
    endangered political power, if that will maintain your hold over economic affairs. "

    "You don't think Haven can fight the Mule?"

    "I don't think Haven will." And now Randu turned his troubled face full upon the psychologist. "I
    think Haven is waiting to surrender. It's what I called you here to tell you. I want you to leave
    Haven."

    Ebling Mis puffed up his plump checks in amazement. "Already?"

    Randu felt horribly tired. "Ebling, you are the Foundation's greatest psychologist. The real
    master-psychologists went out with Seldon, but you're the best we have. You're our only
    chance of defeating the Mule. You can't do that here; you'll have to go to what's left of the
    Empire."

    "To Trantor?"

    "That's right. What was once the Empire is bare bones today, but something must still be at the
    center. They've got the records there, Ebling. You may learn more of mathematical psychology;
    perhaps enough to be able to interpret the clown's mind. He will go with you, of course."

    Mis responded dryly, "I doubt if he'd be willing to, even for fear of the Mule, unless your niece
    went with him."


    I know that. Toran and Bayta are leaving with you for that very reason. And, Ebling, there's



    another, greater purpose. Hari Seldon founded two Foundations three centuries ago; one at
    each end of the Galaxy. You must find that Second Foundation. "


    20. CONSPIRATOR

    The mayor's palace - what was once the mayor's palace - was a looming smudge in the
    darkness. The city was quiet under its conquest and curfew, and the hazy milk of the great
    Galactic Lens, with here and there a lonely star, dominated the sky of the Foundation.

    In three centuries the Foundation had grown from a private project of a small group of scientists
    to a tentacular trade empire sprawling deep into the Galaxy and half a year had flung it from its
    heights to the status of another conquered province.

    Captain Flan Pritcher refused to grasp that.

    The city's sullen nighttime quiet, the darkened palace, intruder-occupied, were symbolic
    enough, but Captain Flan Pritcher, just within the outer gate of the palace, with the tiny nuclear
    bomb under his tongue, refused to understand.

    A shape drifted closer - the captain bent his head.

    The whisper came deathly low, "The alarm system is as it always was, captain. Proceed! It will
    register nothing."

    Softly, the captain ducked through the low archway, and down the fountain-lined path to what
    had been Indbur's garden.

    Four months ago had been the day in the Time Vault, the fullness of which his memory balked
    at. Singly and separately the impressions would come back, unwelcome, mostly at night.

    Old Seldon speaking his benevolent words that were so shatteringly wrong - the jumbled
    confusion - Indbur, with his mayoral costume incongruously bright about his pinched,
    unconscious face - the frightened crowds gathering quickly, waiting noiselessly for the
    inevitable word of surrender - the young man, Toran, disappearing out of a side door with the
    Mule's clown dangling over his shoulder.

    And himself, somehow out of it all afterward, with his car unworkable.

    Shouldering his way along and through the leaderless mob that was already leaving the city -
    destination unknown.

    Making blindly for the various rat holes which were - which had once been - the headquarters
    for a democratic underground that for eighty years had been failing and dwindling.

    And the rat holes were empty.

    The next day, black alien ships were momentarily visible in the sky, sinking gently into the
    clustered buildings of the nearby city. Captain Flan Pritcher felt an accumulation of
    helplessness and despair drown him.



    He started his travels in earnest.


    In thirty days he had covered nearly two hundred miles on foot, changed to the clothing of a
    worker in the hydroponic factories whose body he found newly-dead by the side of the road,
    grown a fierce beard of russet intensity

    And found what was left of the underground.

    The city was Newton, the district a residential one of one-time elegance slowly edging towards
    squalor, the house an undistinguished member of a row, and the man a small-eyed, big-boned
    whose knotted fists bulged through his pockets and whose wiry body remained unbudgingly in
    the narrow door opening.

    The captain mumbled, "I come from Miran."

    The man returned the gambit, grimly. "Miran is early this year."

    The captain said, "No earlier than last year."

    But the man did not step aside. He said, "Who are you?"

    "Aren't you Fox?"

    "Do you always answer by asking?"

    The captain took an imperceptibly longer breath, and then said calmly, "I am Han Pritcher,
    Captain of the Fleet, and member of the Democratic Underground Party. Will you let me in?"

    The Fox stepped aside. He said, "My real name is Orum Palley."

    He held out his hand. The captain took it.

    The room was well-kept, but not lavish. In one comer stood a decorative book-film projector,
    which to the captain's military eyes might easily have been a camouflaged blaster of
    respectable caliber. The projecting lens covered the doorway, and such could be remotely
    controlled.

    The Fox followed his bearded guest's eyes, and smiled tightly. He said, "Yes! But only in the
    days of Indbur and his lackey-hearted vampires. It wouldn't do much against the Mule, eh?
    Nothing would help against the Mule. Are you hungry?"

    The captain's jaw muscles tightened beneath his beard, and he nodded.

    "It'll take a minute if you don't mind waiting." The Fox removed cans from a cupboard and
    placed two before Captain Pritcher. "Keep your finger on it, and break them when they're hot
    enough. My heat-control unit's out of whack. Things like that remind you there's a war on - or
    was on, eh?"

    His quick words had a jovial content, but were said in anything but a jovial tone - and his eyes
    were coldly thoughtful. He sat down opposite the captain and said, "There'll be nothing but a
    burn-spot left where you're sitting, if there's anything about you I don't like. Know that?"



    The captain did not answer. The cans before him opened at a pressure.

    The Fox said, shortly, "Stew! Sorry, but the food situation is short."

    "I know," said the captain. He ate quickly; not looking up.

    The Fox said, "I once saw you. I'm trying to remember, and the beard is definitely out of the
    picture."

    "I haven't shaved in thirty days." Then, fiercely, "What do you want? I had the correct
    passwords. I have identification."

    The other waved a hand, "Oh, I'll grant you're Pritcher all right. But there are plenty who have
    the passwords, and the identifications, and the identities - who are with the Mule. Ever hear of
    Levvaw, eh?"

    "Yes."

    "He's with the Mule."

    "What? He-"

    "Yes. He was the man they called 'No Surrender.'" The Fox's lips made laughing motions, with
    neither sound nor humor. "Then there's Willig. With the Mule! Garre and Noth. With the Mule!
    Why not Pritcher as well, eh? How would I know?"

    The captain merely shook his head.

    "But it doesn't matter," said the Fox, softly. "They must have my name, if Noth has gone over -
    so if you're legitimate, you're in more new danger than I am over our acquaintanceship."

    The captain had finished eating. He leaned back, "If you have no organization here, where can
    I find one? The Foundation may have surrendered, but I haven't."

    "So! You can't wander forever, captain. Men of the Foundation must have travel permits to
    move from town to town these days. You know that? Also identity cards. You have one? Also,
    all officers of the old Navy have been requested to report to the nearest occupation
    headquarters. That's you, eh?"

    "Yes." The captain's voice was hard. "Do you think I run through fear. I was on Kalgan not long
    after its fall to the Mule. Within a month, not one of the old warlord's officers was at large,
    because they were the natural military leaders of any revolt. It's always been the underground's
    knowledge that no revolution can be successful without the control of at least part of the Navy.
    The Mule evidently knows it, too."

    The Fox nodded thoughtfully, "Logical enough. The Mule is thorough."

    "I discarded the uniform as soon as I could. I grew the beard. Afterwards there may be a
    chance that others have taken the same action."


    Are you married?



    "My wife is dead. I have no children.

    "You're hostage-immune, then."

    "Yes."

    "You want my advice?"

    "If you have any."

    A don't know what the Mule's policy is or what he intends, but skilled workers have not been
    harmed so far. Pay rates have gone up. Production of all sorts of nuclear weapons is booming."

    "Yes? Sounds like a continuing offensive."

    "I don't know. The Mule's a subtle son of a drab, and he may merely be soothing the workers
    into submission. If Seldon couldn't figure him out with all his psychohistory, I'm not going to try.
    But you're wearing work clothes. That suggests something, eh?"

    "I'm not a skilled worker."

    "You've had a military course in nucleics, haven't you?"

    "Certainly."

    "That's enough. The Nuclear-Field Bearings, Inc., is located here in town. Tell them you've had
    experience. The stinkers who used to run the factory for Indbur are still running it - for the
    Mule. They won't ask questions, as long as they need more workers to make their fat hunk.
    They'll give you an identity card and you can apply for a room in the Corporation's housing
    district. You might start now."

    In that manner, Captain Han Pritcher of the National Fleet became Shield-man Lo Moro of the
    45 Shop of Nuclear-Field Bearings, Inc. And from an Intelligence agent, he descended the
    social scale to "conspirator"- a calling which led him months later to what had been Indbur's
    private garden,

    In the garden, Captain Pritcher consulted the radometer in the palm of his hand. The inner
    warning field was still in operation, and he waited. Half an hour remained to the life of the
    nuclear bomb in his mouth. He rolled it gingerly with his tongue.

    The radometer died into an ominous darkness and the captain advanced quickly.

    So far, matters had progressed well.

    He reflected objectively that the life of the nuclear bomb was his as well; that its death was his
    death - and the Mule's death.

    And the grand climacteric of a four-month's private war would be reached; a war that had
    passed from flight through a Newton factory

    For two months, Captain Pritcher wore leaden aprons and heavy face shields, till all things
    military had been frictioned off his outer bearing. He was a laborer, who collected his pay, spent



    his evenings in town, and never discussed politics.

    For two months, he did not see the Fox.

    And then, one day, a man stumbled past his bench, and there was a scrap of paper in his
    pocket. The word "Fox" was on it. Fie tossed it into the nuclear chamber, where it vanished in a
    sightless puff, sending the energy output up a millimicrovolt - and turned back to his work.

    That night he was at the Fox's home, and took a hand in a game of cards with two other men
    he knew by reputation and one by name and face.

    Over the cards and the passing and repassing tokens, they spoke.

    The captain said, "It's a fundamental error. You live in the exploded past. For eighty years our
    organization has been waiting for the correct historical moment. We've been blinded by
    Seldon's psychohistory, one of the first propositions of which is that the individual does not
    count, does not make history, and that complex social and economic factors override him,
    make a puppet out of him." Fie adjusted his cards carefully, appraised their value and said, as
    he put out a token. "Why not kill the Mule?"

    "Well, now, and what good would that do?" demanded the man at his left, fiercely.

    "You see," said the captain, discarding two cards, "that's the attitude. What is one man - out of
    quadrillions. The Galaxy won't stop rotating because one man dies. But the Mule is not a man,
    he is a mutant. Already, he had upset Seldon's plan, and if you'll stop to analyze the
    implications, it means that he - one man - one mutant - upset all of Seldon's psychohistory. If
    he had never lived, the Foundation would not have fallen. If he ceased living, it would not
    remain fallen.

    "Come, the democrats have fought the mayors and the traders for eighty years by connivery.
    Let's try assassination."

    "Flow?" interposed the Fox, with cold common sense.

    The captain said, slowly, "I've spent three months of thought on that with no solution. I came
    here and had it in five minutes." Fie glanced briefly at the man whose broad, pink melon of a
    face smiled from the place at his right. "You were once Mayor Indbur's chamberlain. I did not
    know you were of the underground,"

    "Nor I, that you were."

    "Well, then, in your capacity as chamberlain you periodically checked the working of the alarm
    system of the palace."

    "I did."

    "And the Mule occupies the palace now."

    "So it has been announced - though he is a modest conqueror who makes no speeches,
    proclamations nor public appearances of any sort."

    "That's an old story, and affects nothing. You, my ex-chamberlain, are all we need."



    The cards were shown and the Fox collected the stakes. Slowly, he dealt a new hand.

    The man who had once been chamberlain picked up his cards, singly. "Sorry, captain. I
    checked the alarm system, but it was routine. I know nothing about it."

    "I expected that, but your mind carries an eidetic memory of the controls if it can be probed
    deeply enough - with a psychic probe."

    The chamberlain's ruddy face paled suddenly and sagged. The cards in his hand crumpled
    under sudden fist-pressure, "A psychic probe?"

    "You needn't worry," said the captain, sharply. "I know how to use one. It will not harm you past
    a few days' weakness. And if it did, it is the chance you take and the price you pay. There are
    some among us, no doubt, who from the controls of the alarm could determine the wavelength
    combinations. There are some among us who could manufacture a small bomb under
    time-control and I myself will carry it to the Mule."

    The men gathered over the table.

    The captain announced, "On a given evening, a riot will start in Terminus City in the
    neighborhood of the palace. No real fighting. Disturbance - then flight. As long as the palace
    guard is attracted ... or, at the very least, distracted-"

    From that day for a month the preparations went on, and Captain Flan Pritcher of the National
    Fleet having become conspirator descended further in the social scale and became an
    "assassin."

    Captain Pritcher, assassin, was in the palace itself, and found himself grimly pleased with his
    psychology. A thorough alarm system outside meant few guards within. In this case, it meant
    none at all.

    The floor plan was clear in his mind. Fie was a blob moving noiselessly up the well-carpeted
    ramp. At its head, he flattened against the wall and waited.

    The small closed door of a private room was before him. Behind that door must be the mutant
    who had beaten the unbeatable. Fie was early - the bomb had ten minutes of life in it.

    Five of these passed, and still in all the world there was no sound. The Mule had five minutes to
    live - So had Captain Pritcher-

    He stepped forward on sudden impulse. The plot could no longer fail. When the bomb went, the
    palace would go with it - all the palace. A door between - ten yards between - was nothing.

    But he wanted to see the Mule as they died together.

    In a last, insolent gesture, he thundered upon the door.

    And it opened and let out the blinding light.

    Captain Pritcher staggered, then caught himself. The solemn man, standing in the center of the
    small room before a suspended fish bowl, looked up mildly.

    FHis uniform was a somber black, and as he tapped the bowl in an absent gesture, it bobbed



    quickly and the feather-finned, orange and vermilion fish within darted wildly.

    He said, "Come in, captain!"

    To the captain's quivering tongue the little metal globe beneath was swelling ominously - a
    physical impossibility, the captain knew. But it was in its last minute of life.

    The uniformed man said, "You had better spit out the foolish pellet and free yourself for speech.
    It won't blast."

    The minute passed and with a slow, sodden motion the captain bent his head and dropped the
    silvery globe into his palm. With a furious force it was flung against the wall. It rebounded with a
    tiny, sharp clangor, gleaming harmlessly as it flew.

    The uniformed man shrugged. "So much for that, then. It would have done you no good in any
    case, captain. I am not the Mule. You will have to be satisfied with his viceroy."

    "How did you know?" muttered the captain, thickly.

    "Blame it on an efficient counter-espionage system. I can name every member of your little
    gang, every step of their planning-"

    "And you let it go this far?"

    "Why not? It has been one of my great purposes here to find you and some others. Particularly
    you. I might have had you some months ago, while you were still a worker at the Newton
    Bearings Works, but this is much better. If you hadn't suggested the main outlines of the plot
    yourself, one of my own men would have advanced something of much the same sort for you.
    The result is quite dramatic, and rather grimly humorous."

    The captain's eyes were hard. "I find it so, too. Is it all over now?"

    "Just begun. Come, captain, sit down. Let us leave heroics for the fools who are impressed by
    it. Captain, you are a capable man. According to the information I have, you were the first on
    the Foundation to recognize the power of the Mule. Since then you have interested yourself,
    rather daringly, in the Mule's early life. You have been one of those who carried off his clown,
    who, incidentally, has not yet been found, and for which there will yet be full payment. Naturally,
    your ability is recognized and the Mule is not of those who fear the ability of his enemies as
    long as he can convert it into the ability of a new friend."

    "Is that what you're hedging up to? Oh, no!"

    "Oh, yes! It was the purpose of tonight's comedy. You are an intelligent man, yet your little
    conspiracies against die Mule fail humorously. You can scarcely dignify it with the name of
    conspiracy. Is it part of your military training to waste ships in hopeless actions?"

    "One must first admit them to be hopeless."

    "One will," the viceroy assured him, gently. "The Mule has conquered the Foundation, It is
    rapidly being turned into an arsenal for accomplishment of his greater aims."

    "What greater aims?"



    "The conquest of the entire Galaxy. The reunion of all the tom worlds into a new Empire. The
    fulfillment, you dull-witted patriot, of your own Seldon's dream seven hundred years before he
    hoped to see it. And in the fulfillment, you can help us."

    "I can, undoubtedly. But I won't, undoubtedly."

    "I understand," reasoned the viceroy, "that only three of the Independent Trading Worlds yet
    resist. They will not last much longer. It will be the last of all Foundation forces. You still hold
    out."

    "Yes."

    "Yet you won't. A voluntary recruit is the, most efficient. But the other kind will do.

    Unfortunately, the Mule is absent. He leads the fight, as always, against the resisting Traders.
    But he is in continual contact with us. You will not have to wait long."

    "For what?"

    "For your conversion.

    "The Mule," said the captain, frigidly, "will find that beyond his ability."

    "But he won't. I was not beyond it. You don't recognize me? Come, you were on Kalgan, so you
    have seen me. I wore a monocle, a fur-lined scarlet robe, a high-crowned hat-"

    The captain stiffened in dismay. "You were the warlord of Kalgan."

    "Yes. And now I am the loyal viceroy of the Mule. You see, he is persuasive."


    21. INTERLUDE IN SPACE

    The blockade was run successfully. In the vast volume of space, not all the navies ever in
    existence could keep their watch in tight proximity. Given a single ship, a skillful pilot, and a
    moderate degree of luck, and there are holes and to spare.

    With cold-eyed calm, Toran drove a protesting vessel from the vicinity of one star to that of
    another. If the neighborhood of great mass made an interstellar jump erratic and difficult, it also
    made the enemy detection devices useless or nearly so.

    And once the girdle of ships had been passed the inner sphere of dead space, through whose
    blockaded sub-ether no message could be driven, was passed as well. For the first time in over
    three months Toran felt unisolated.

    A week passed before the enemy news programs dealt with anything more than the dull,
    self-laudatory details of growing control over the Foundation. It was a week in which Toran's
    armored trading ship fled inward from the Periphery in hasty jumps.

    Ebling Mis called out to the pilot room and Toran rose blink-eyed from his charts.

    "What's the matter?" Toran stepped down into the small central chamber which Bayta had



    inevitably devised into a living room.

    Mis shook his head, "Bescuppered if I know. The Mule's newsmen are announcing a special
    bulletin. Thought you might want to get in on it."

    "Might as well. Where's Bayta?"

    "Setting the table in the diner and picking out a menuor some such frippery."

    Toran sat down upon the cot that served as Magnifico's bed, and waited. The propaganda
    routine of the Mule's "special bulletins" were monotonously similar. First the martial music, and
    then the buttery slickness of the announcer. The minor news items would come, following one
    another in patient lock step. Then the pause. Then the trumpets and the rising excitement and
    the climax.

    Toran endured it. Mis muttered to himself.

    The newscaster spilled out, in conventional war-correspondent phraseology, the unctuous
    words that translated into sound the molten metal and blasted flesh of a battle in space.

    "Rapid cruiser squadrons under Lieutenant General Sammin hit back hard today at the task
    force striking out from Iss-" The carefully expressionless face of the speaker upon the screen
    faded into the blackness of a space cut through by the quick swaths of ships reeling across
    emptiness in deadly battle. The voice continued through the soundless thunder

    "The most striking action of the battle was the subsidiary combat of the heavy cruiser Cluster
    against three enemy ships of the 'Nova' class-"

    The screen's view veered and closed in. A great ship sparked and one of the frantic attackers
    glowed angrily, twisted out of focus, swung back and rammed. The Cluster bowed wildly and
    survived the glancing blow that drove the attacker off in twisting reflection.

    The newsman's smooth unimpassioned delivery continued to the last blow and the last hulk.

    Then a pause, and a large similar voice-and-picture of the fight off Mnemon, to which the
    novelty was added of a lengthy description of a hit-and-run landing - the picture of a blasted
    city - huddled and weary prisoners - and off again.

    Mnemon had not long to live.

    The pause again - and this time the raucous sound of the expected brasses. The screen faded
    into the long, impressively soldier-lined corridor up which the government spokesman in
    councilor's uniform strode quickly.

    The silence was oppressive.

    The voice that came at last was solemn, slow and hard: "By order of our sovereign, it is
    announced that the planet, Haven, hitherto in warlike opposition to his will, has submitted to the
    acceptance of defeat. At this moment, the forces of our sovereign are occupying the planet.
    Opposition was scattered, unco-ordinated, and speedily crushed."



    The scene faded out, the original newsman returned to state importantly that other
    developments would be transmitted as they occurred.

    Then there was dance music, and Ebling Mis threw the shield that cut the power.

    Toran rose and walked unsteadily away, without a word. The psychologist made no move to
    stop him.

    When Bayta stepped out of the kitchen, Mis motioned silence.

    He said, "They've taken Haven."

    And Bayta said, "Already?" Her eyes were round, and sick with disbelief.

    "Without a fight. Without an unprin-" He stopped and swallowed. "You'd better leave Toran
    alone. It's not pleasant for him. Suppose we eat without him this once."

    Bayta looked once toward the pilot room, then turned hopelessly. "Very well!"

    Magnifico sat unnoticed at the table. He neither spoke nor ate but stared ahead with a
    concentrated fear that seemed to drain all the vitality out of his thread of a body.

    Ebling Mis pushed absently at his iced-fruit dessert and said, harshly, "Two Trading worlds
    fight. They fight, and bleed, and die and don't surrender. Only at Haven - Just as at the
    Foundation-"

    "But why? Why?"

    The psychologist shook his head. "It's of a piece with all the problem. Every queer facet is a
    hint at the nature of the Mule. First, the problem of how he could conquer the Foundation, with
    little blood, and at a single blow essentially - while the Independent Trading Worlds held out.
    The blanket on nuclear reactions was a puny weapon - we've discussed that back and forth till
    I'm sick of it - and it did not work on any but the Foundation.

    "Randu suggested," and Ebling's grizzly eyebrows pulled together, "it might have been a
    radiant Will-Depresser. It's what might have done the work on Haven. But then why wasn't it
    used on Mnemon and Iss - which even now fight with such demonic intensity that it is taking
    half the Foundation fleet in addition to the Mule's forces to beat them down. Yes, I recognized
    Foundation ships in the attack."

    Bayta whispered, "The Foundation, then Haven. Disaster seems to follow us, without touching.
    We always seem to get out by a hair. Will it last forever?"

    Ebling Mis was not listening. To himself, he was making a point. "But there's another problem -
    another problem. Bayta, you remember the news item that the Mule's clown was not found on
    Terminus; that it was suspected he had fled to Haven, or been carried there by his original
    kidnappers. There is an importance attached to him, Bayta, that doesn't fade, and we have not
    located it yet. Magnifico must know something that is fatal to the Mule. I'm sure of it. "

    Magnifico, white and stuttering, protested, "Sire ... noble lord ... indeed, I swear it is past my
    poor reckoning to penetrate your wants. I have told what I know to the utter limits, and with your



    probe, you have drawn out of my meager wit that which I knew, but knew not that I knew."

    "I know ... I know. It is something small. A hint so small that neither you nor I recognize it for
    what it is. Yet I must find it - for Mnemon and Iss will go soon, and when they do, we are the
    last remnants, the last droplets of the independent Foundation."

    The stars begin to cluster closely when the core of the Galaxy is penetrated. Gravitational fields
    begin to overlap at intensities sufficient to introduce perturbations in an interstellar jump that
    can not be overlooked.

    Toran became aware of that when a jump landed their ship in the full glare of a red giant which
    clutched viciously, and whose grip was loosed, then wrenched apart, only after twelve
    sleepless, soul-battering hours.

    With charts limited in scope, and an experience not at all fully developed, either operationally or
    mathematically, Toran resigned himself to days of careful plotting between jumps.

    It became a community project of a sort. Ebling Mis checked Toran's mathematics and Bayta
    tested possible routes, by the various generalized methods, for the presence of real solutions.
    Even Magnifico was put to work on the calculating machine for routine computations, a type of
    work, which, once explained, was a source of great amusement to him and at which he was
    surprisingly proficient.

    So at the end of a month, or nearly, Bayta was able to survey the red line that wormed its way
    through the ship's trimensional model of the Galactic Lens halfway to its center, and say with
    Satiric relish, "You know what it looks like. It looks like a ten-foot earth-worm with a terrific case
    of indigestion. Eventually, you'll land us back in Haven."

    "I will," growled Toran, with a fierce rustle of his chart, "if you don't shut up."

    "And at that," continued Bayta, "there is probably a route fight through, straight as a meridian of
    longitude."

    "Yeah? Well, in the first place, dimwit, it probably took five hundred ships five hundred years to
    work out that route by hit-and-miss, and my lousy half-credit charts don't give it. Besides,
    maybe those straight routes are a good thing to avoid. They're probably choked up with ships.
    And besides-"

    "Oh, for Galaxy's sake, stop driveling and slavering so much righteous indignation." Her hands
    were in his hair.

    He yowled, "Ouch! Let go!" seized her wrists and whipped downward, whereupon Toran, Bayta,
    and chair formed a tangled threesome on the floor. It degenerated into a panting wrestling
    match, composed mostly of choking laughter and various foul blows.

    Toran broke loose at Magnifico's breathless entrance.

    "What is it?"

    The lines of anxiety puckered the clown's face and tightened the skin whitely over the
    enormous bridge of his nose. "The instruments are behaving queerly, sir. I have not, in the



    knowledge of my ignorance, touched anything-"

    In two seconds, Toran was in the pilot room. He said quietly to Magnifico, "Wake up Ebling Mis.
    Have him come down here."

    He said to Bayta, who was trying to get a basic order back to her hair by use of her fingers,
    "We've been detected, Bay."

    "Detected?" And Bayta's arms dropped. "By whom?"

    "Galaxy knows," muttered Toran, "but I imagine by someone with blasters already ranged and
    trained."

    He sat down and in a low voice was already sending into the sub-ether the ship's identification
    code.

    And when Ebling Mis entered, bathrobed and blear-eyed, Toran said with a desperate calm, "It
    seems we're inside the borders of a local Inner Kingdom which is called the Autarchy of Filia."

    "Never heard of it," said Mis, abruptly.

    "Well, neither did I," replied Toran, "but we're being stopped by a Filian ship just the same, and
    I don't know what it will involve."

    The captain-inspector of the Filian ship crowded aboard with six armed men following him. He
    was short, thin-haired, thin-lipped, and dry-skinned. He coughed a sharp cough as he sat down
    and threw open the folio under his arm to a blank page.

    "Your passports and ship's clearance, please."

    "We have none," said Toran.

    "None, hey?" he snatched up a microphone suspended from his belt and spoke into it quickly,
    "Three men and one woman. Papers not in order." He made an accompanying notation in the
    folio.

    He said, "Where are you from?"

    "Siwenna," said Toran warily.

    "Where is that?"

    "Thirty thousand parsecs, eighty degrees west Trantor, forty degrees-"

    "Never mind, never mind!" Toran could see that his inquisitor had written down: "Point of origin
    - Periphery."

    The Filian continued, "Where are you going?"

    Toran said, "Trantor sector."

    "Purpose?"



    "Pleasure trip."

    "Carrying any cargo?"

    "No."

    "Hm-m-m. We'll check on that." He nodded and two men jumped to activity. Toran made no
    move to interfere.

    "What brings you into Filian territory?" The Filian's eyes gleamed unamiably.

    "We didn't know we were. I lack a proper chart."

    "You will be required to pay a hundred credits for that lack - and, of course, the usual fees
    required for tariff duties, et cetera."

    He spoke again into the microphone - but listened more than he spoke. Then, to Toran, "Know
    anything about nuclear technology?"

    "A little," replied Toran, guardedly.

    "Yes?" The Filian closed his folio, and added, "The men of the Periphery have a knowledgeable
    reputation that way. Put on a suit and come with me."

    Bayta stepped forward, "What are you going to do with him?"

    Toran put her aside gently, and asked coldly, "Where do you want me to come?"

    "Our power plant needs minor adjustments. He'll come with you." His pointing finger aimed
    directly at Magnifico, whose brown eyes opened wide in a blubbery dismay.

    "What's he got to do with it?" demanded Toran fiercely.

    The official looked up coldly. "I am informed of pirate activities in this vicinity. A description of
    one of the known thugs tallies roughly. It is a purely routine matter of identification. "

    Toran hesitated, but six men and six blasters are eloquent arguments. He reached into the
    cupboard for the suits.

    An hour later, he rose upright in the bowels of the Filian ship and raged, "There's not a thing
    wrong with the motors that I can see. The busbars are true, the L-tubes are feeding properly
    and the reaction analysis checks. Who's in charge here?"

    The head engineer said quietly, "I am."

    "Well, get me out of here-"

    He was led to the officers' level and the small anteroom held only an indifferent ensign.

    "Where's the man who came with me?"

    "Please wait," said the ensign.

    It was fifteen minutes later that Magnifico was brought in.



    "What did they do to you?" asked Toran quickly.

    "Nothing. Nothing at all." Magnifico's head shook a slow negative.

    It took two hundred and fifty credits to fulfill the demands of Filia - fifty credits of it for instant
    release - and they were in free space again.

    Bayta said with a forced laugh, "Don't we rate an escort? Don't we get the usual figurative boot
    over the border?"

    And Toran replied, grimly, "That was no Filian ship - and we're not leaving for a while. Come in
    here."

    They gathered about him.

    Fie said, whitely, "That was a Foundation ship, and those were the Mule's men aboard."

    Ebling bent to pick up the cigar he had dropped. Fie said, "Flere? We're fifteen thousand
    parsecs from the Foundation. "

    "And we're here. What's to prevent them from making the same trip. Galaxy, Ebling, don't you
    think I can tell ships apart? I saw their engines, and that's enough for me. I tell you it was a
    Foundation engine in a Foundation ship."

    "And how did they get here?" asked Bayta, logically. "What are the chances of a random
    meeting of two given ships in space?"

    "What's that to do with it?" demanded Toran, hotly. "It would only show we've been followed."
    "Followed?" hooted Bayta. "Through hyperspace?"

    Ebling Mis interposed wearily, "That can be done - given a good ship and a great pilot. But the
    possibility doesn't impress me."

    "I haven't been masking my trail," insisted Toran. "I've been building up take-off speed on the
    straight. A blind man could have calculated our route."

    "The blazes he could," cried Bayta. "With the cockeyed jumps you are making, observing our
    initial direction didn't mean a thing. We came out of the jump wrong-end forwards more than
    once."

    "We're wasting time," blazed Toran, with gritted teeth. "It's a Foundation ship under the Mule.
    It's stopped us. It's searched us. It's had Magnifico - alone - with me as hostage to keep the
    rest of you quiet, in case you suspected. And we're going to bum it out of space right now."

    "Flold on now," and Ebling Mis clutched at him. "Are you going to destroy us for one ship you
    think is an enemy? Think, man, would those scuppers chase us over an impossible route half
    through the bestinkered Galaxy, look us over, and then let us go?'

    "They're still interested in where we're going."

    "Then why stop us and put us on our guard? You can't have it both ways, you know."



    "I'll have it my way. Let go of me, Ebling, or I'll knock you down."

    Magnifico leaned forward from his balanced perch on his favorite chair back. His long nostrils
    flared with excitement. "I crave your pardon for my interruption, but my poor mind is of a
    sudden plagued with a queer thought."

    Bayta anticipated Toran's gesture of annoyance, and added her grip to Ebling's. "Go ahead and
    speak, Magnifico. We will all listen faithfully."

    Magnifico said, "In my stay in their ship what addled wits I have were bemazed and bemused
    by a chattering fear that befell men. Of a truth I have a lack of memory of most that happened.
    Many men staring at me, and talk I did not understand. But towards the last - as though a
    beam of sunlight had dashed through a cloud rift - there was a face I knew. A glimpse, the
    merest glimmer - and yet it glows in my memory ever stronger and brighter."

    Toran said, "Who was it?"

    "That captain who was with us so long a time ago, when first you saved me from slavery."

    It had obviously been Magnifico's intention to create a sensation, and the delighted smile that
    curled broadly in the shadow of his proboscis, attested to his realization of the intention's
    success.

    "Captain ... Han ... Pritcher?" demanded Mis, sternly. "You're sure of that? Certain sure now?"

    "Sir, I swear," and he laid a bone-thin hand upon his narrow chest. "I would uphold the truth of it
    before the Mule and swear it in his teeth, though all his power were behind him to deny it."

    Bayta said in pure wonder, "Then what's it all about?" The clown faced her eagerly, "My lady, I
    have a theory. It came upon me, ready made, as though the Galactic Spirit had gently laid it in
    my mind." He actually raised his voice above Toran's interrupting objection.

    "My lady," he addressed himself exclusively to Bayta, "if this captain had, like us, escaped with
    a ship; if he, like us, were on a trip for a purpose of his own devising; if he blundered upon us -
    he would suspect us of following and waylaying him, as we suspect him of the like. What
    wonder he played this comedy to enter our ship?"

    "Why would he want us in his ship, then?" demanded Toran. "That doesn't fit."

    "Why, yes, it does," clamored the clown, with a flowing inspiration. "He sent an underling who
    knew us not, but who described us into his microphone. The listening captain would be struck
    at my own poor likeness - for, of a truth there are not many in this great Galaxy who bear a
    resemblance to my scantiness. I was the proof of the identity of the rest of you."

    "And so he leaves us?"

    "What do we know of his mission, and the secrecy thereof? lie has spied us out for not an
    enemy and having it done so, must he needs think it wise to risk his plan by widening the
    knowledge thereof?"

    Bayta said slowly, "Don't be stubborn, Torie. It does explain things."



    "It could be," agreed Mis.

    Toran seemed helpless in the face of united resistance. Something in the clown's fluent
    explanations bothered him. Something was wrong. Yet he was bewildered and, in spite of
    himself, his anger ebbed.

    "For a while," he whispered, "I thought we might have had one of the Mule's ships."

    And his eyes were dark with the pain of Haven's loss.

    The others understood.


    22. DEATH ON NEOTRANTOR

    NEOTRANTOR The small planet of Dellcass, renamed after the Great Sack, was for nearly a
    century, the seat of the last dynasty of the First Empire. It was a shadow world and a shadow
    Empire and Its existence Is only of legalistic importance. Under the first of the Neotrantorlan
    dynasty....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Neotrantor was the name! New Trantor! And when you have said the name you have
    exhausted at a stroke all the resemblances of the new Trantor to the great original. Two
    parsecs away, the sun of Old Trantor still shone and the Galaxy's Imperial Capital of the
    previous century still cut through space in the silent and eternal repetition of its orbit.

    Men even inhabited Old Trantor. Not many - a hundred million, perhaps, where fifty years
    before, forty billions had swarmed. The huge, metal world was in jagged splinters. The towering
    thrusts of the multi-towers from the single world-girdling base were torn and empty - still
    bearing the original blastholes and firegut - shards of the Great Sack of forty years earlier.

    It was strange that a world which had been the center of a Galaxy for two thousand years - that
    had ruled limitless space and been home to legislators and rulers whose whims spanned the
    parsecs - could die in a month. It was strange that a world which had been untouched through
    the vast conquering sweeps and retreats of a millennia, and equally untouched by the civil wars
    and palace revolutions of other millennia - should lie dead at last. It was strange that the Glory
    of the Galaxy should be a rotting corpse.

    And pathetic!

    For centuries would yet pass before the mighty works of fifty generations of humans would
    decay past use. Only the declining powers of men, themselves, rendered them useless now.

    The millions left after the billions had died tore up the gleaming metal base of the planet and
    exposed soil that had not felt the touch of sun in a thousand years.

    Surrounded by the mechanical perfections of human efforts, encircled by the industrial marvels
    of mankind freed of the tyranny of environment - they returned to the land. In the huge traffic



    clearings, wheat and corn grew. In the shadow of the towers, sheep grazed.

    But Neotrantor existed - an obscure village of a planet drowned in the shadow of mighty
    Trantor, until a heart-throttled royal family, racing before the fire and flame of the Great Sack
    sped to it as its last refuge - and held out there, barely, until the roaring wave of rebellion
    subsided. There it ruled in ghostly splendor over a cadaverous remnant of Imperium.

    Twenty agricultural worlds were a Galactic Empire!

    Dagobert IX, ruler of twenty worlds of refractory squires and sullen peasants, was Emperor of
    the Galaxy, Lord of the Universe.

    Dagobert IX had been twenty-five on the bloody day he arrived with his father upon Neotrantor.
    His eyes and mind were still alive with the glory and the power of the Empire that was. But his
    son, who might one day be Dagobert X, was born on Neotrantor.

    Twenty worlds were all he knew.

    Jord Commason's open air car was the finest vehicle of its type on all Neotrantor - and, after
    all, justly so. It did not end with the fact that Commason was the largest landowner on
    Neotrantor. It began there. For in earlier days he had been the companion and evil genius of a
    young crown prince, restive in the dominating grip of a middle-aged emperor. And now he was
    the companion and still the evil genius of a middle-aged crown prince who hated and
    dominated an old emperor.

    So Jord Commason, in his air car, which in mother-of-pearl finish and gold-and-lumetron
    ornamentation needed no coat of arms as owner's identification, surveyed the lands that were
    his, and the miles of rolling wheat that were his, and the huge threshers and harvesters that
    were his, and the tenant-farmers and machine-tenders that were his - and considered his
    problems cautiously.

    Beside him, his bent and withered chauffeur guided the ship gently through the upper winds
    and smiled.

    Jord Commason spoke to the wind, the air, and the sky, "You remember what I told you,
    Inchney?"

    Inchney's thin gray hair wisped lightly in the wind. His gap-toothed smile widened in its
    thin-lipped fashion and the vertical wrinkles of his cheeks deepened as though he were keeping
    an eternal secret from himself. The whisper of his voice whistled between his teeth.

    "I remember, sire, and I have thought."

    "And what have you thought, Inchney?" There was an impatience about the question.

    Inchney remembered that he had been young and handsome, and a lord on Old Trantor.
    Inchney remembered that he was a disfigured ancient on Neotrantor, who lived by grace of
    Squire Jord Commason, and paid for the grace by lending his subtlety on request. He sighed
    very softly.

    He whispered again, "Visitors from the Foundation, sire, are a convenient thing to have.



    Especially, sire, when they come with but a single ship, and but a single fighting man. How
    welcome they might be."

    "Welcome?" said Commason, gloomily. "Perhaps so. But those men are magicians and may be
    powerful."

    "Pugh," muttered Inchney, "the mistiness of distance hides the truth. The Foundation is but a
    world. Its citizens are but men. If you blast them, they die."

    Inchney held the ship on its course - A river was a winding sparkle below. He whispered, "And
    is there not a man they speak of now who stirs the worlds of the Periphery?"

    Commason was suddenly suspicious. "What do you know of this?"

    There was no smile on his chauffeur's face. "Nothing, sire. It was but an idle question."

    The squire's hesitation was short. He said, with brutal directness, "Nothing you ask is idle, and
    your method of acquiring knowledge will have your scrawny neck in a vise yet. But - I have it!
    This man is called the Mule, and a subject of his had been here some months ago on a ...
    matter of business. I await another ... now ... for its conclusion."

    "And these newcomers? They are not the ones you want, perhaps?"

    "They lack the identification they should have."

    "It has been reported that the Foundation has been captured-"

    "I did not tell you that."

    "It has been so reported," continued Inchney, coolly, "and if that is correct, then these may be
    refugees from the destruction, and may be held for the Mule's man out of honest friendship."

    "Yes?" Commason was uncertain.

    "And, sire, since it is well-known that the friend of a conqueror is but the last victim, it would be
    but a measure of honest self-defense. For there are such things as psychic probes, and here
    we have four Foundation brains. There is much about the Foundation it would be useful to
    know, much even about the Mule. And then the Mule's friendship would be a trifle the less
    overpowering."

    Commason, in the quiet of the upper air, returned with a shiver to his first thought. "But if the
    Foundation has not fallen. If the reports are lies. It is said that it has been foretold it can not
    fall."

    "We are past the age of soothsayers, sire."

    "And yet if it did not fall, Inchney. Think! If it did not fall. The Mule made me promises, indeed-"
    He had gone too far, and backtracked. "That is, he made boasts. But boasts are wind and
    deeds are hard."


    Inchney laughed noiselessly. "Deeds are hard indeed, until begun. One could scarcely find a
    further fear than a Galaxy-end Foundation."



    "There is still the prince," murmured Commason, almost to himself.

    "He deals with the Mule also, then, sire?"

    Commason could not quite choke down the complacent shift of features. "Not entirely. Not as /
    do. But he grows wilder, more uncontrollable. A demon is upon him. If I seize these people and
    he takes them away for his own use - for he does not lack a certain shrewdness - I am not yet
    ready to quarrel with him." He frowned and his heavy cheeks bent downwards with dislike.

    "I saw those strangers for a few moments yesterday," said the gray chauffeur, irrelevantly, "and
    it is a strange woman, that dark one. she walks with the freedom of a man and she is of a
    startling paleness against the dark luster of hair." There was almost a warmth in the husky
    whisper of the withered voice, so that Commason turned toward him in sudden surprise.

    Inchney continued, "The prince, I think, would not find his shrewdness proof against a
    reasonable compromise. You could have the rest, if you left him the girl-"

    A light broke upon Commason, "A thought! Indeed a thought! Inchney, turn back! And Inchney,
    if all turns well, we will discuss further this matter of your freedom."

    It was with an almost superstitious sense of symbolism that Commason found a Personal
    Capsule waiting for him in his private study when he returned. It had arrived by a wavelength
    known to few. Commason smiled a fat smile. The Mule's man was coming and the Foundation
    had indeed fallen.

    Bayta's misty visions, when she had them, of an Imperial palace, did not jibe with the reality,
    and inside her, there was a vague sense of disappointment. The room was small, almost plain,
    almost ordinary. The palace did not even match the mayor's residence back at the Foundation
    - and Dagobert IX -

    Bayta had definite ideas of what an emperor ought to look like. He ought not look like
    somebody's benevolent grandfather. He ought not be thin and white and faded - or serving
    cups of tea with his own hand in an expressed anxiety for the comfort of his visitors.

    But so it was.

    Dagobert IX chuckled as he poured tea into her stiffly outheld cup.

    "This is a great pleasure for me, my dear. It is a moment away from ceremony and courtiers. I
    have not had the opportunity for welcoming visitors from my outer provinces for a time now. My
    son takes care of these details now that I'm older. You haven't met my son? A fine boy.
    Headstrong, perhaps. But then he's young. Do you care for a flavor capsule? No?"

    Toran attempted an interruption, "Your imperial majesty-"

    "Yes?"

    "Your imperial majesty, it has not been our intention to intrude upon you-"

    "Nonsense, there is no intrusion. Tonight there will be the official reception, but until then, we
    are free. Let's see, where did you say you were from? It seems a long time since we had an



    official reception. You said you were from the Province of Anacreon?"

    "From the Foundation, your imperial majesty!"

    "Yes, the Foundation. I remember now. I had it located. It is in the Province of Anacreon. I have
    never been there. My doctor forbids extensive traveling. I don't recall any recent reports from
    my viceroy at Anacreon. Flow are conditions there?" he concluded anxiously.

    "Sire," mumbled Toran, "I bring no complaints."

    "That is gratifying. I will commend my viceroy."

    Toran looked helplessly at Ebling Mis, whose brusque voice rose. "Sire, we have been told that
    it will require your permission for us to visit the Imperial University Library on Trantor."

    "Trantor?" questioned the emperor, mildly, "Trantor?"

    Then a look of puzzled pain crossed his thin face. "Trantor?" he whispered. "I remember now. I
    am making plans now to return there with a flood of ships at my back. You shall come with me.
    Together we will destroy the rebel, Gilmer. Together we shall restore the empire!"

    His bent back had straightened. His voice had strengthened. For a moment his eyes were hard.
    Then, he blinked and said softly, "But Gilmer is dead. I seem to remember - Yes. Yes! Gilmer
    is dead! Trantor is dead - For a moment, it seemed - Where was it you said you came from?"

    Magnifico whispered to Bayta, "Is this really an emperor? For somehow I thought emperors
    were greater and wiser than ordinary men."

    Bayta motioned him quiet. She said, "If your imperial majesty would but sign an order permitting
    us to go to Trantor, it would avail greatly the common cause."

    "To Trantor?" The emperor was blank and uncomprehending.

    "Sire, the Viceroy of Anacreon, in whose name we speak, sends word that Gilmer is yet alive-"
    "Alive! Alive!" thundered Dagobert. "Where? It will be war!"

    "Your imperial majesty, it must not yet be known. His whereabouts are uncertain. The viceroy
    sends us to acquaint you of the fact, and it is only on Trantor that we may find his hiding place.
    Once discovered-"

    "Yes, yes - Fie must be found-" The old emperor doddered to the wall and touched the little
    photocell with a trembling finger. Fie muttered, after an ineffectual pause, "My servants do not
    come. I can not wait for them."

    Fie was scribbling on a blank sheet, and ended with a flourished "D." Fie said, "Gilmer will yet
    learn the power of his emperor. Where was it you came from? Anacreon? What are the
    conditions there? Is the name of the emperor powerful?"

    Bayta took the paper from his loose fingers, "Your imperial majesty is beloved by the people.
    Your love for them is widely known."



    "I shall have to visit my good people of Anacreon, but my doctor says ... I don't remember what
    he says, but-" He looked up, his old gray eyes sharp, "Were you saying something of Gilmer?"

    "No, your imperial majesty."

    "He shall not advance further. Go back and tell your people that. Trantor shall hold! My father
    leads the fleet now, and the rebel vermin Gilmer shall freeze in space with his regicidal rabble."

    He staggered into a seat and his eyes were blank once more. "What was I saying?"

    Toran rose and bowed low, "Your imperial majesty has been kind to us, but the time allotted us
    for an audience is over. "

    For a moment, Dagobert IX looked like an emperor indeed as he rose and stood stiff-backed
    while, one by one, his visitors retreated backward through the door

    -to where twenty armed men intervened and locked a circle about them.

    A hand-weapon flashed-

    To Bayta, consciousness returned sluggishly, but without the "Where am I?" sensation. She
    remembered clearly the odd old man who called himself emperor, and the other men who
    waited outside. The arthritic tingle in her finger joints meant a stun pistol.

    She kept her eyes closed, and listened with painful attention to the voices.

    There were two of them. One was slow and cautious, with a slyness beneath the surface
    obsequity. The other was hoarse and thick, almost sodden, and blurted out in viscous spurts.
    Bayta liked neither.

    The thick voice was predominant.

    Bayta caught the last words, "He will live forever, that old madman. It wearies me. It annoys
    me. Commason, I will have it. I grow older, too."

    "Your highness, let us first see of what use these people are. It may be we shall have sources
    of strength other than your father still provides."

    The thick voice was lost in a bubbling whisper. Bayta caught only the phrase, " -the girl-" but
    the other, fawning voice was a nasty, low, running chuckle followed by a comradely,
    near-patronizing, "Dagobert, you do not age. They lie who say you are not a youth of twenty."

    They laughed together, and Bayta's blood was an icy trickle. Dagobert - your highness - The
    old emperor had spoken of a headstrong son, and the implication of the whispers now beat
    dully upon her. But such things didn't happen to people in real life—

    Toran's voice broke upon her in a slow, hard current of cursing.

    She opened her eyes, and Toran's, which were upon her, showed open relief. He said, fiercely,
    "This banditry will be answered by the emperor. Release us."

    It dawned upon Bayta that her wrists and ankles were fastened to wall and floor by a tight



    attraction field.


    Thick Voice approached Toran. He was paunchy, his lower eyelids puffed darkly, and his hair
    was thinning out. There was a gay feather in his peaked hat, and the edging of his doublet was
    embroidered with silvery metal-foam.

    He sneered with a heavy amusement. "The emperor? The poor, mad emperor?"

    "I have his pass. No subject may hinder our freedom."

    "But I am no subject, space-garbage. I am the regent and crown prince and am to be
    addressed as such. As for my poor silly father, it amuses him to see visitors occasionally. And
    we humor him. It tickles his mock-imperial fancy. But, of course, it has no other meaning."

    And then he was before Bayta, and she looked up at him contemptuously. He leaned close and
    his breath was overpoweringly minted.

    He said, "Her eyes suit well, Commason - she is even prettier with them open. I think she'll do.
    It will be an exotic dish for a jaded taste, eh?"

    There was a futile surge upwards on Toran's part, which the crown prince ignored and Bayta
    felt the iciness travel outward to the skin. Ebling Mis was still out; head lolling weakly upon his
    chest, but, with a sensation of surprise, Bayta noted that Magnifico's eyes were open, sharply
    open, as though awake for many minutes. Those large brown eyes swiveled towards Bayta and
    stared at her out of a doughy face.

    He whimpered, and nodded with his head towards the crown prince, "That one has my
    Visi-Sonor."

    The crown prince turned sharply toward the new voice, "This is yours, monster?" He swung the
    instrument from his shoulder where it had hung, suspended by its green strap, unnoticed by
    Bayta.

    He fingered it clumsily, tried to sound a chord and got nothing for his pains, "Can you play it,
    monster?"

    Magnifico nodded once.

    Toran said suddenly, "You've rifled a ship of the Foundation. If the emperor will not avenge, the
    Foundation will."

    It was the other, Commason, who answered slowly, "What Foundation? Or is the Mule no
    longer the Mule?"

    There was no answer to that. The prince's grin showed large uneven teeth. The clown's binding
    field was broken and he was nudged ungently to his feet. The Visi-Sonor was thrust into his
    hand.

    "Play for us, monster," said the prince. "Play us a serenade of love and beauty for our foreign
    lady here. Tell her that my father's country prison is no palace, but that I can take her to one
    where she can swim in rose water - and know what a prince's love is. Sing of a prince's love,



    monster.


    He placed one thick thigh upon a marble table and swung a leg idly, while his fatuous smiling
    stare swept Bayta into a silent rage. Toran's sinews strained against the field, in painful,
    perspiring effort. Ebling Mis stirred and moaned.

    Magnifico gasped, "My fingers are of useless stiffness-"

    "Play, monster!" roared the prince. The lights dimmed at a gesture to Commason and in the
    dimness he crossed his arms and waited.

    Magnifico drew his fingers in rapid, rhythmic jumps from end to end of the multikeyed
    instrument - and a sharp, gliding rainbow of light jumped across the room. A low, soft tone
    sounded - throbbing, tearful. It lifted in sad laughter, and underneath it there sounded a dull
    tolling.

    The darkness seemed to intensify and grow thick. Music reached Bayta through the muffled
    folds of invisible blankets. Gleaming light reached her from the depths as though a single
    candle glowed at the bottom of a pit.

    Automatically, her eyes strained. The light brightened, but remained blurred. It moved fuzzily, in
    confused color, and the music was suddenly brassy, evil - flourishing in high crescendo. The
    light flickered quickly, in swift motion to the wicked rhythm. Something writhed within the light.
    Something with poisonous metallic scales writhed and yawned. And the music writhed and
    yawned with it.

    Bayta struggled with a strange emotion and then caught herself in a mental gasp. Almost, it
    reminded her of the time in the Time Vault, of those last days on Haven. It was that horrible,
    cloying, clinging spiderweb of horror and despair. She shrunk beneath it oppressed.

    The music dinned upon her, laughing horribly, and the writhing terror at the wrong end of the
    telescope in the small circle of light was lost as she turned feverishly away. Her forehead was
    wet and cold.

    The music died. It must have lasted fifteen minutes, and a vast pleasure at its absence flooded
    Bayta. Light glared, and Magnifico's face was close to hers, sweaty, wild-eyed, lugubrious.

    "My lady," he gasped, "how fare you?"

    "Well enough," she whispered, "but why did you play like that?"

    She became aware of the others in the room. Toran and Mis were limp and helpless against
    the wall, but her eyes skimmed over them. There was the prince, lying strangely still at the foot
    of the table. There was Commason, moaning wildly through an open, drooling mouth.

    Commason flinched, and yelled mindlessly, as Magnifico took a step towards him.

    Magnifico turned, and with a leap, turned the others loose.

    Toran lunged upwards and with eager, taut fists seized the landowner by the neck, "You come
    with us. We'll want you - to make sure we get to our ship."



    Two hours later, in the ship's kitchen, Bayta served a walloping homemade pie, and Magnifico
    celebrated the return to space by attacking it with a magnificent disregard of table manners.

    "Good, Magnifico?"

    "Um-m-m-m!"

    "Magnifico?"

    "Yes, my lady?"

    "What was it you played back there?"

    The clown writhed, "I ... I'd rather not say. I learned it once, and the Visi-Sonor is of an effect
    upon the nervous system most profound. Surely, it was an evil thing, and not for your sweet
    innocence, my lady."

    "Oh, now, come, Magnifico. I'm not as innocent as that. Don't flatter so. Did I see anything like
    what f/7eysaw?"

    "I hope not. I played it for them only. If you saw, it was but the rim of it - from afar."

    "And that was enough. Do you know you knocked the prince out?"

    Magnifico spoke grimly through a large, muffling piece of pie. "I killed h\rr\, my lady."

    "What?" She swallowed, painfully.

    "He was dead when I stopped, or I would have continued. I cared not for Commason. His
    greatest threat was death or torture. But, my lady, this prince looked upon you wickedly, and-"
    he choked in a mixture of indignation and embarrassment.

    Bayta felt strange thoughts come and repressed them sternly. "Magnifico, you've got a gallant
    soul."

    "Oh, my lady." He bent a red nose into his pie, but, somehow did not eat.

    Ebling Mis stared out the port. Trantor was near - its metallic shine fearfully bright. Toran was
    standing there, too.

    He said with dull bitterness, "We've come for nothing, Ebling. The Mule's man precedes us."

    Ebling Mis rubbed his forehead with a hand that seemed shriveled out of its former plumpness.
    His voice was an abstracted mutter.

    Toran was annoyed. "I say those people know the Foundation has fallen. I say-"

    "Eh?" Mis looked up, puzzled. Then, he placed a gentle hand upon Toran's wrist, in complete
    oblivion of any previous conversation, "Toran, I ... I've been looking at Trantor. Do you know ... I
    have the queerest feeling ... ever since we arrived on Neotrantor. It's an urge, a driving urge
    that's pushing and pushing inside. Toran, I can do it; I know I can do it. Things are becoming
    clear in my mind - they have never been so clear."



    Toran stared - and shrugged. The words brought him no confidence.

    He said, tentatively, "Mis?"

    "Yes?"

    "You didn't see a ship come down on Neotrantor as we left?"

    Consideration was brief. "No."

    "I did. Imagination, I suppose, but it could have been that Filian ship."

    "The one with Captain Han Pritcher on it?"

    "The one with space knows who upon it. Magnifico's information - It followed us here, Mis."
    Ebling Mis said nothing,

    Toran said strenuously, "is there anything wrong with you? Aren't you well?"

    Mis's eyes were thoughtful, luminous, and strange. He did not answer.


    23. THE RUINS OF TRANTOR

    The location of an objective upon the great world of Trantor presents a problem unique in the
    Galaxy. There are no continents or oceans to locate from a thousand miles distance. There are
    no rivers, lakes, and islands to catch sight of through the cloud rifts.

    The metal-covered world was - had been - one colossal city, and only the old Imperial palace
    could be identified readily from outer space by a stranger. The Bayta circled the world at almost
    air-car height in repeated painful search.

    From polar regions, where the icy coating of the metal spires were somber evidence of the
    breakdown or neglect of the weather-conditioning machinery, they worked southwards.
    Occasionally they could experiment with the correlations -(or presumable correlations)-
    between what they saw and what the inadequate map obtained at Neotrantor showed.

    But it was unmistakable when it came. The gap in the metal coat of the planet was fifty miles.
    The unusual greenery spread over hundreds of square miles, inclosing the mighty grace of the
    ancient Imperial residences.

    The Bayta hovered and slowly oriented itself. There were only the huge supercauseways to
    guide them. Long straight arrows on the map, smooth, gleaming ribbons there below them.

    What the map indicated to be the University area was reached by dead reckoning, and upon
    the flat area of what once must have been a busy landing-field, the ship lowered itself.

    It was only as they submerged into the welter of metal that the smooth beauty apparent from
    the air dissolved into the broken, twisted near-wreckage that had been left in the wake of the
    Sack. Spires were truncated, smooth walls gouted and twisted, and just for an instant there was



    the glimpse of a shaven area of earth - perhaps several hundred acres in extent - dark and
    plowed.

    Lee Senter waited as the ship settled downward cautiously. It was a strange ship, not from
    Neotrantor, and inwardly he sighed. Strange ships and confused dealings with the men of outer
    space could mean the end of the short days of peace, a return to the old grandiose times of
    death and battle. Senter was leader of the group; the old books were in his charge and he had
    read of those old days. He did not want them.

    Perhaps ten minutes spent themselves as the strange ship came down to nestle upon the
    flatness, but long memories telescoped themselves in that time. There was first the great farm
    of his childhood - that remained in his mind merely as busy crowds of people. Then there was
    the trek of the young families to new lands. He was ten, then; an only child, puzzled, and
    frightened.

    Then the new buildings; the great metal slabs to be uprooted and tom aside; the exposed soil
    to be turned, and freshened, and invigorated; neighboring buildings to be tom down and
    leveled; others to be transformed to living quarters.

    There were crops to be grown and harvested; peaceful relations with neighboring farms to be
    established-

    There was growth and expansion, and the quiet efficiency of self-rule. There was the coming of
    a new generation of hard, little youngsters born to the soil. There was the great day when he
    was chosen leader of the Group and for the first time since his eighteenth birthday he did not
    shave and saw the first stubble of his Leader's Beard appear.

    And now the Galaxy might intrude and put an end to the brief idyll of isolation-

    The ship landed. He watched wordlessly as the port opened. Four emerged, cautious and
    watchful. There were three men, varied, old, young, thin and beaked. And a woman striding
    among them like an equal. His hand left the two glassy black tufts of his beard as he stepped
    forward.

    He gave the universal gesture of peace. Both hands were before him; hard, calloused palms
    upward.

    The young man approached two steps and duplicated the gesture. "I come in peace."

    The accent was strange, but the words were understandable, and welcome. He replied, deeply,
    "In peace be it. You are welcome to the hospitality of the Group. Are you hungry? You shall eat.
    Are you thirsty? You shall drink."

    Slowly, the reply came, "We thank you for your kindness, and shall bear good report of your
    Group when we return to our world."

    A queer answer, but good. Behind him, the men of the Group were smiling, and from the
    recesses of the surrounding structures, the women emerged.

    In his own quarters, he removed the locked, mirror-walled box from its hidden place, and



    offered each of the guests the long, plump cigars that were reserved for great occasions.

    Before the woman, he hesitated. She had taken a seat among the men. The strangers
    evidently allowed, even expected, such effrontery. Stiffly, he offered the box.

    She accepted one with a smile, and drew in its aromatic smoke, with all the relish one could
    expect. Lee Senter repressed a scandalized emotion.

    The stiff conversation, in advance of the meal, touched politely upon the subject of fanning on
    Trantor.

    It was the old man who asked, "What about hydroponics? Surely, for such a world as Trantor,
    hydroponics would be the answer."

    Senter shook his head slowly. He felt uncertain. His knowledge was the unfamiliar matter of the
    books he had read, "Artificial fanning in chemicals, I think? No, not on Trantor. This
    hydroponics requires a world of industy - for instance, a great chemical industry. And in war or
    disaster, when industry breaks down, the people starve. Nor can all foods be grown artificially.
    Some lose their food value. The soil is cheaper, still better - always more dependable."

    "And your food supply is sufficient?"

    "Sufficient; perhaps monotonous. We have fowl that supply eggs, and milk-yielders for our dairy
    products - but our meat supply rests upon our foreign trade."

    "Trade." The young man seemed roused to sudden interest. "You trade then. But what do you
    export?"

    "Metal," was the curt answer. "Look for yourself. We have an infinite supply, ready processed.
    They come from Neotrantor with ships, demolish an indicated area-increasing our growing
    space - and leave us in exchange meat, canned fruit, food concentrates, farm machinery and
    so on. They carry off the metal and both sides profit."

    They feasted on bread and cheese, and a vegetable stew that was unreservedly delicious. It
    was over the dessert of frosted fruit, the only imported item on the menu, that, for the first time,
    the Outlanders became other than mere guests. The young man produced a map of Trantor.

    Calmly, Lee Senter studied it. He listened - and said gravely, "The University Grounds are a
    static area. We farmers do not grow crops on it. We do not, by preference, even enter it. It is
    one of our few relics of another time we would keep undisturbed. "

    "We are seekers after knowledge. We would disturb nothing. Our ship would be our hostage."
    The old man offered this - eagerly, feverishly.

    "I can take you there then," said Senter.

    That night the strangers slept, and that night Lee Senter sent a message to Neotrantor.



    24. CONVERT

    The thin life of Trantor trickled to nothing when they entered among the wide-spaced buildings
    of the University grounds. There was a solemn and lonely silence over it.

    The strangers of the Foundation knew nothing of the swirling days and nights of the bloody
    Sack that had left the University untouched. They knew nothing of the time after the collapse of
    the Imperial power, when the students, with their borrowed weapons, and their pale-faced
    inexperienced bravery, formed a protective volunteer army to protect the central shrine of the
    science of the Galaxy. They knew nothing of the Seven Days Fight, and the armistice that kept
    the University free, when even the Imperial palace clanged with the boots of Gilmer and his
    soldiers, during the short interval of their rule.

    Those of the Foundation, approaching for the first time, realized only that in a world of transition
    from a gutted old to a strenuous new this area was a quiet, graceful museum-piece of ancient
    greatness.

    They were intruders in a sense. The brooding emptiness rejected them. The academic
    atmosphere seemed still to live and to stir angrily at the disturbance.

    The library was a deceptively small building which broadened out vastly underground into a
    mammoth volume of silence and reverie. Ebling Mis paused before the elaborate murals of the
    reception room.

    Fie whispered - one had to whisper here: "I think we passed the catalog rooms back a way. I'll
    stop there."

    His forehead was flushed, his hand trembling, "I mustn't be disturbed, Toran. Will you bring my
    meals down to me?"

    "Anything you say. We'll do all we can to help. Do you want us to work under you-"

    "No. I must be alone-"

    "You think you will get what you want."

    And Ebling Mis replied with a soft certainty, "I know I will!"

    Toran and Bayta came closer to "setting up housekeeping" in normal fashion than at any time
    in their year of married life. It was a strange sort of "housekeeping." They lived in the middle of
    grandeur with an inappropriate simplicity. Their food was drawn largely from Lee Senter's farm
    and was paid for in the little nuclear gadgets that may be found on any Trader's ship.

    Magnifico taught himself how to use the projectors in the library reading room, and sat over
    adventure novels and romances to the point where he was almost as forgetful of meals and
    sleep as was Ebling Mis.

    Ebling himself was completely buried. Fie had insisted on a hammock being slung up for him in
    the Psychology Reference Room. His face grew thin and white. His vigor of speech was lost
    and his favorite curses had died a mild death. There were times when the recognition of either



    Toran or Bayta seemed a struggle.

    He was more himself with Magnifico who brought him his meals and often sat watching him for
    hours at a time, with a queer, fascinated absorption, as the aging psychologist transcribed
    endless equations, cross-referred to endless book-films, scurried endlessly about in a wild
    mental effort towards an end he alone saw.

    Toran came upon her in the darkened room, and said sharply, "Bayta!"

    Bayta started guiltily. "Yes? You want me, Torie?"

    "Sure I want you. What in Space are you sitting there for? You've been acting all wrong since
    we got to Trantor. What's the matter with you?"

    "Oh, Torie, stop," she said, wearily.

    And "Oh, Torie, stop!" he mimicked impatiently. Then, with sudden softness, "Won't you tell me
    what's wrong, Bay? Something's bothering you."

    "No! Nothing is, Torie. If you keep on just nagging and nagging, you'll have me mad. I'm just —
    thinking."

    "Thinking about what?"

    "About nothing. Well, about the Mule, and Haven, and the Foundation, and everything. About
    Ebling Mis and whether he'll find anything about the Second Foundation, and whether it will
    help us when he does find it - and a million other things. Are you satisfied?" Her voice was
    agitated.

    "If you're just brooding, do you mind stopping? It isn't pleasant and it doesn't help the situation."
    Bayta got to her feet and smiled weakly. "All right. I'm happy. See, I'm smiling and jolly. "
    Magnifico's voice was an agitated cry outside. "My lady-"

    "What is it? Come-"

    Bayta's voice choked off sharply when the opening door framed the large, hard-faced-
    "Pritcher," cried Toran.

    Bayta gasped, "Captain! How did you find us?"

    Han Pritcher stepped inside. His voice was clear and level, and utterly dead of feeling, "My rank
    is colonel now - under the Mule."

    "Under the ... Mule!" Toran's voice trailed off. They formed a tableau there, the three.

    Magnifico stared wildly and shrank behind Toran. Nobody stopped to notice him.

    Bayta said, her hands trembling in each other's tight grasp, "You are arresting us? You have
    really gone over to them?"



    The colonel replied quickly, "I have not come to arrest you. My instructions make no mention of
    you. With regard to you, I am free, and I choose to exercise our old friendship, if you will let
    me."

    Toran's face was a twisted suppression of fury, "How did you find us? You were in the Filian
    ship, then? You followed us?"

    The wooden lack of expression on Pritcher's face might have flickered in embarrassment. "I
    was on the Filian ship! I met you in the first place ... well ... by chance."

    "It is a chance that is mathematically impossible."

    "No. Simply rather improbable, so my statement will have to stand. In any case, you admitted to
    the. Filians - there is, of course, no such nation as Filia actually - that you were heading for the
    Trantor sector, and since the Mule already had his contacts upon Neotrantor, it was easy to
    have you detained there. Unfortunately, you got away before I arrived, but not long before. I
    had time to have the farms on Trantor ordered to report your arrival. It was done and I am here.
    May I sit down? I come in friendliness, believe me.

    He sat. Toran bent his head and thought futilely. With a numbed lack of emotion, Bayta
    prepared tea.

    Toran looked up harshly. "Well, what are you waiting for - colonel? What's your friendship? If
    it's not arrest, what is it then? Protective custody? Call in your men and give your orders."

    Patiently, Pritcher shook his head. "No, Toran. I come of my own will to speak to you, to
    persuade you of the uselessness of what you are doing. If I fail I shall leave. That is all."

    "That is all? Well, then peddle your propaganda, give us your speech, and leave. I don't want
    any tea, Bayta."

    Pritcher accepted a cup, with a grave word of thanks. He looked at Toran with a clear strength
    as he sipped lightly. Then he said, "The Mule is a mutant. He can not be beaten in the very
    nature of the mutation-"

    "Why? What is the mutation?" asked Toran, with sour humor. "I suppose you'll tell us now, eh?"

    "Yes, I will. Your knowledge won't hurt him. You see - he is capable of adjusting the emotional
    balance of human beings. It sounds like a little trick, but it's quite unbeatable."

    Bayta broke in, "The emotional balance?" She frowned, "Won't you explain that? I don't quite
    understand."

    "I mean that it is an easy matter for him to instill into a capable general, say, the emotion of
    utter loyalty to the Mule and complete belief in the Mule's victory. His generals are emotionally
    controlled. They can not betray him; they can not weaken - and the control is permanent. His
    most capable enemies become his most faithful subordinates, The warlord of Kalgan
    surrenders his planet and becomes his viceroy for the Foundation."

    "And you," added Bayta, bitterly, "betray your cause and become Mule's envoy to Trantor. I
    see!"



    "I haven't finished. The Mule's gift works in reverse even more effectively. Despair is an
    emotion! At the crucial moment, keymen on the Foundation - keymen on Haven - despaired.
    Their worlds fell without too much struggle."

    "Do you mean to say," demanded Bayta, tensely, "that the feeling I had in the Time Vault was
    the Mule juggling my emotional control."

    "Mine, too. Everyone's. How was it on Haven towards the end?"

    Bayta turned away.

    Colonel Pritcher continued earnestly, "As it works for worlds, so it works for individuals. Can
    you fight a force which can make you surrender willingly when it so desires; can make you a
    faithful servant when it so desires?"

    Toran said slowly, "How do I know this is the truth?"

    "Can you explain the fall of the Foundation and of Haven otherwise? Can you explain my
    conversion otherwise? Think, man! What have you - or I - or the whole Galaxy accomplished
    against the Mule in all this time? What one little thing?"

    Toran felt the challenge, "By the Galaxy, I can!" With a sudden touch of fierce satisfaction, he
    shouted, "Your wonderful Mule had contacts with Neotrantor you say that were to have
    detained us, eh? Those contacts are dead or worse. We killed the crown prince and left the
    other a whimpering idiot. The Mule did not stop us there, and that much has been undone."

    "Why, no, not at all. Those weren't our men. The crown prince was a wine-soaked mediocrity.
    The other man, Commason, is phenomenally stupid. He was a power on his world but that
    didn't prevent him from being vicious, evil, and completely incompetent. We had nothing really
    to do with them. They were, in a sense, merely feints-"

    "It was they who detained us, or tried."

    "Again, no. Commason had a personal slave - a man called Inchney. Detention was his policy.
    He is old, but will serve our temporary purpose. You would not have killed him, you see."

    Bayta whirled on him. She had not touched her own tea. "But, by your very statement, your own
    emotions have been tampered with. You've got faith and belief in the Mule, an unnatural, a
    diseased faith in the Mule. Of what value are your opinions? You've lost all power of objective
    thought."

    "You are wrong." Slowly, the colonel shook his head. "Only my emotions are fixed. My reason
    is as it always was. It may be influenced in a certain direction by my conditioned emotions, but
    it is not forced. And there are some things I can see more clearly now that I am freed of my
    earlier emotional trend.

    "I can see that the Mule's program is an intelligent and worthy one. In the time since I have
    been - converted, I have followed his career from its start seven years ago. With his mutant
    mental power, he began by winning over a condottiere and his band. With that - and his power
    - he won a planet. With that - and his power - he extended his grip until he could tackle the



    warlord of Kalgan. Each step followed the other logically. With Kalgan in his pocket, he had a
    first-class fleet, and with that - and his power - he could attack the Foundation.

    "The Foundation is the key. It is the greatest area of industrial concentration in the Galaxy, and
    now that the nuclear techniques of the Foundation are in his hands, he is the actual master of
    the Galaxy. With those techniques - and his power - he can force the remnants of the Empire
    to acknowledge his rule, and eventually - with the death of the old emperor, who is mad and
    not long for this world - to crown him emperor. Fie will then have the name as well as the fact.
    With that - and his power - where is the world in the Galaxy that can oppose him?

    "In these last seven years, he has established a new Empire. In seven years, in other words, he
    will have accomplished what all Seldon's psychohistory could not have done in less than an
    additional seven hundred. The Galaxy will have peace and order at last.

    "And you could not stop it - any more than you could stop a planet's rush with your shoulders."

    A long silence followed Pritcher's speech. What remained of his tea had grown cold. Fie
    emptied his cup, filled it again, and drained it slowly. Toran bit viciously at a thumbnail. Bayta's
    face was cold, and distant, and white.

    Then Bayta said in a thin voice, "We are not convinced. If the Mule wishes us to be, let him
    come here and condition us himself. You fought him until the last moment of your conversion, I
    imagine, didn't you?"

    "I did," said Colonel Pritcher, solemnly.

    "Then allow us the same privilege."

    Colonel Pritcher arose. With a crisp air of finality, he said, "Then I leave. As I said earlier, my
    mission at present concerns you in no way. Therefore, I don't think it will be necessary to report
    your presence here. That is not too great a kindness. If the Mule wishes you stopped, he no
    doubt has other men assigned to the job, and you will be stopped. But, for what it is worth, I
    shall not contribute more than my requirement."

    "Thank you," said Bayta faintly.

    "As for Magnifico. Where is he? Come out, Magnifico, I won't hurt you-"

    "What about him?" demanded Bayta, with sudden animation.

    "Nothing. My instructions make no mention of him, either. I have heard that he is searched for,
    but the Mule will find him when the time suits him. I shall say nothing. Will you shake hands?"

    Bayta shook her head. Toran glared his frustrated contempt.

    There was the slightest lowering of the colonel's iron shoulders. Fie strode to the door, turned
    and said:

    "One last thing. Don't think I am not aware of the source of your stubbornness. It is known that
    you search for the Second Foundation. The Mule, in his time, will take his measures. Nothing
    will help you - But I knew you in other times; perhaps there is something in my conscience that



    urged me to this; at any rate, I tried to help you and remove you from the final danger before it
    was too late. Good-by."

    He saluted sharply - and was gone.

    Bayta turned to a silent Toran, and whispered, "They even know about the Second
    Foundation."

    In the recesses of the library, Ebling Mis, unaware of all, crouched under the one spark of light
    amid the murky spaces and mumbled triumphantly to himself.


    25. DEATH OF A PSYCHOLOGIST

    After that there were only two weeks left to the life of Ebling Mis.

    And in those two weeks, Bayta was with him three times. The first time was on the night after
    the evening upon which they saw Colonel Pritcher. The second was one week later. And the
    third was again a week later - on the last day - the day Mis died.

    First, there was the night of Colonel Pritcher's evening, the first hour of which was spent by a
    stricken pair in a brooding, unmerry merry-go-round.

    Bayta said, "Torie, let's tell Ebling."

    Toran said dully, "Think he can help?"

    "We're only two. We've got to take some of the weight off. Maybe he can help."

    Toran said, "He's changed. He's lost weight. He's a little feathery; a little woolly." His fingers
    groped in air, metaphorically. "Sometimes, I don't think he'll help us muchever. Sometimes, I
    don't think anything will help."

    "Don't!" Bayta's voice caught and escaped a break, "Torie, don't! When you say that, I think the
    Mule's getting us. Let's tell Ebling, Torie - now!"

    Ebling Mis raised his head from the long desk, and bleared at them as they approached. His
    thinning hair was scuffed up, his lips made sleepy, smacking sounds.

    "Eh?" he said. "Someone want me?"

    Bayta bent to her knees, "Did we wake you? Shall we leave?"

    "Leave? Who is it? Bayta? No, no, stay! Aren't there chairs? I saw them-" His finger pointed
    vaguely.

    Toran pushed two ahead of him. Bayta sat down and took one of the psychologist's flaccid
    hands in hers. "May we talk to you, Doctor?" She rarely used the title.

    "Is something wrong?" A little sparkle returned to his abstracted eyes. His sagging cheeks
    regained a touch of color. "Is something wrong?"



    Bayta said, "Captain Pritcher has been here. Let me talk, Torie. You remember Captain
    Pritcher, Doctor?"

    "Yes- Yes-" His fingers pinched his lips and released them. "Tall man. Democrat."

    "Yes, he. He's discovered the Mule's mutation. He was here, Doctor, and told us."

    "But that is nothing new. The Mule's mutation is straightened out." In honest astonishment,
    "Haven't I told you? Have I forgotten to tell you?"

    "Forgotten to tell us what?" put in Toran, quickly.

    "About the Mule's mutation, of course. He tampers with emotions. Emotional control! I haven't
    told you? Now what made me forget?" Slowly, he sucked in his under lip and considered.

    Then, slowly, life crept into his voice and his eyelids lifted wide, as though his sluggish brain
    had slid onto a well-greased single track. He spoke in a dream, looking between the two
    listeners rather than at them. "It is really so simple. It requires no specialized knowledge. In the
    mathematics of psychohistory, of course, it works out promptly, in a third-level equation
    involving no more - Never mind that. It can be put into ordinary words - roughly - and have it
    make sense, which isn't usual with psychohistorical phenomena.

    "Ask yourselves - What can upset Hari Seldon's careful scheme of history, eh?" He peered
    from one to the other with a mild, questioning anxiety. "What were Seldon's original
    assumptions? First, that there would be no fundamental change in human society over the next
    thousand years.

    "For instance, suppose there were a major change in the Galaxy's technology, such as finding
    a new principle for the utilization of energy, or perfecting the study of electronic neurobiology.
    Social changes would render Seldon's original equations obsolete. But that hasn't happened,
    has it now?"

    "Or suppose that a new weapon were to be invented by forces outside the Foundation, capable
    of withstanding all the Foundation's armaments. That might cause a ruinous deviation, though
    less certainly. But even that hasn't happened. The Mule's Nuclear Field-Depressor was a
    clumsy weapon and could be countered. And that was the only novelty he presented, poor as it
    was.

    "But there was a second assumption, a more subtle one! Seldon assumed that human reaction
    to stimuli would remain constant. Granted that the first assumption held true, then the second
    must have broken down! Some factor must be twisting and distorting the emotional responses
    of human beings or Seldon couldn't have failed and the Foundation couldn't have fallen. And
    what factor but the Mule?

    "Am I right? Is there a flaw in the reasoning?"

    Bayta's plump hand patted his gently. "No flaw, Ebling."

    Mis was joyful, like a child. "This and more comes so easily. I tell you I wonder sometimes what
    is going on inside me. I seem to recall the time when so much was a mystery to me and now



    things are so clear. Problems are absent. I come across what might be one, and somehow,
    inside me, I see and understand. And my guesses, my theories seem always to be borne out.
    There's a drive in me ... always onward ... so that I can't stop ... and I don't want to eat or sleep
    ... but always go on ... and on ... and on-"

    His voice was a whisper; his wasted, blue-veined hand rested tremblingly upon his forehead.
    There was a frenzy in his eyes that faded and went out.

    He said more quietly, "Then I never told you about the Mule's mutant powers, did I? But then ...
    did you say you knew about it?"

    "It was Captain Pritcher, Ebling," said Bayta. "Remember?"

    "He told you?" There was a tinge of outrage in his tone. "But how did he find out?"

    "He's been conditioned by the Mule. He's a colonel now, a Mule's man. He came to advise us
    to surrender to the Mule, and he told us - what you told us."

    "Then the Mule knows we're here? I must hurry - Where's Magnifico? Isn't he with you?"
    "Magnifico's sleeping," said Toran, impatiently. "It's past midnight, you know."

    "It is? Then - Was I sleeping when you came in?"

    "You were," said Bayta decisively, "and you're not going back to work, either. You're getting into
    bed. Come on, Torie, help me. And you stop pushing at me, Ebling, because it's just your luck I
    don't shove you under a shower first. Pull off his shoes, Torie, and tomorrow you come down
    here and drag him out into the open air before he fades completely away. Look at you, Ebling,
    you'll be growing cobwebs. Are you hungry?"

    Ebling Mis shook his head and looked up from his cot in a peevish confusion. "I want you to
    send Magnifico down tomorrow," he muttered.

    Bayta tucked the sheet around his neck. "You'll have me down tomorrow, with washed clothes.
    You're going to take a good bath, and then get out and visit the farm and feel a little sun on
    you."

    "I won't do it," said Mis weakly. "You hear me? I'm too busy."

    His sparse hair spread out on the pillow like a silver fringe about his head. His voice was a
    confidential whisper. "You want that Second Foundation, don't you?"

    Toran turned quickly and squatted down on the cot beside him. "What about the Second
    Foundation, Ebling?"

    The psychologist freed an arm from beneath the sheet and his tired fingers clutched at Toran's
    sleeve. "The Foundations were established at a great Psychological Convention presided over
    by Hari Seldon. Toran, I have located the published minutes of that Convention. Twenty-five fat
    films. I have already looked through various summaries."


    Well?



    "Well, do you know that it is very easy to find from them the exact location of the First
    Foundation, if you know anything at all about psychohistory. It is frequently referred to, when
    you understand the equations. But Toran, nobody mentions the Second Foundation, There has
    been no reference to it anywhere."

    Toran's eyebrows pulled into a frown. "It doesn't exist?"

    "Of course it exists," cried Mis, angrily, "who said it didn't? But there's less talk of it. Its
    significance - and all about it - are better hidden, better obscured. Don't you see? It's the more
    important of the two. It's the critical one; the one that counts! And I've got the minutes of the
    Seldon Convention. The Mule hasn't won yet-"

    Quietly, Bayta turned the lights down. "Go to sleep!"

    Without speaking, Toran and Bayta made their way up to their own quarters.

    The next day, Ebling Mis bathed and dressed himself, saw the sun of Trantor and felt the wind
    of Trantor for the last time. At the end of the day he was once again submerged in the gigantic
    recesses of the library, and never emerged thereafter.

    In the week that followed, life settled again into its groove. The sun of Neotrantor was a calm,
    bright star in Trantor's night sky. The farm was busy with its spring planting. The University
    grounds were silent in their desertion. The Galaxy seemed empty. The Mule might never have
    existed.

    Bayta was thinking that as she watched Toran light his cigar carefully and look up at the
    sections of blue sky visible between the swarming metal spires that encircled the horizon.

    "It's a nice day," he said.

    "Yes, it is. Flave you everything mentioned on the list, Torie?"

    "Sure. Half pound butter, dozen eggs, string beans - Got it all down here, Bay. I'll have it right."

    "Good. And make sure the vegetables are of the last harvest and not museum relics. Did you
    see Magnifico anywhere, by the way?"

    "Not since breakfast. Guess he's down with Ebling, watching a book-film."

    "All right. Don't waste any time, because I'll need the eggs for dinner."

    Toran left with a backward smile and a wave of the hand.

    Bayta turned away as Toran slid out of sight among the maze of metal. She hesitated before
    the kitchen door, about-faced slowly, and entered the colonnade leading to the elevator that
    burrowed down into the recesses.

    Ebling Mis was there, head bent down over the eyepieces of the projector, motionless, a
    frozen, questing body. Near him sat Magnifico, screwed up into a chair, eyes sharp and
    watching - a bundle of slatty limbs with a nose emphasizing his scrawny face.

    Bayta said softly, "Magnifico-"



    Magnifico scrambled to his feet. His voice was an eager whisper. "My lady!"

    "Magnifico," said Bayta, "Toran has left for the farm and won't be back for a while. Would you
    be a good boy and go out after him with a message that I'll write for you?"

    "Gladly, my lady. My small services are but too eagerly yours, for the tiny uses you can put
    them to."

    She was alone with Ebling Mis, who had not moved. Firmly, she placed her hand upon his
    shoulder. "Ebling-"

    The psychologist started, with a peevish cry, "What is it?" He wrinkled his eyes. "Is it you,
    Bayta? Where's Magnifico?"

    "I sent him away. I want to be alone with you for a while." She enunciated her words with
    exaggerated distinctness. "I want to talk to you, Ebling."

    The psychologist made a move to return to his projector, but her hand on his shoulder was firm.
    She felt the bone under the sleeve clearly. The flesh seemed to have fairly melted away since
    their arrival on Trantor. His face was thin, yellowish, and bore a half-week stubble. His
    shoulders were visibly stooped, even in a sitting position.

    Bayta said, "Magnifico isn't bothering you, is he, Ebling? He seems to be down here night and
    day."

    "No, no, no! Not at all. Why, I don't mind him. He is silent and never disturbs me. Sometimes he
    carries the films back and forth for me; seems to know what I want without my speaking. Just
    let him be."

    "Very well - but, Ebling, doesn't he make you wonder? Do you hear me, Ebling? Doesn't he
    make you wonder?"

    She jerked a chair close to his and stared at him as though to pull the answer out of his eyes.
    Ebling Mis shook his head. "No. What do you mean?"

    "I mean that Colonel Pritcher and you both say the Mule can condition the emotions of human
    beings. But are you sure of it? Isn't Magnifico himself a flaw in the theory?"

    There was silence.

    Bayta repressed a strong desire to shake the psychologist. "What's wrong with you, Ebling?
    Magnifico was the Mule's clown. Why wasn't he conditioned to love and faith? Why should he,
    of all those in contact with the Mule, hate him so.

    "But ... but he was conditioned. Certainly, Bay!" He seemed to gather certainty as he spoke.

    "Do you suppose that the Mule treats his clown the way he treats his generals? He needs faith
    and loyalty in the latter, but in his clown he needs only fear. Didn't you ever notice that
    Magnifico's continual state of panic is pathological in nature? Do you suppose it is natural for a
    human being to be as frightened as that all the time? Fear to such an extent becomes comic. It
    was probably comic to the Mule - and helpful, too, since it obscured what help we might have



    gotten earlier from Magnifico."

    Bayta said, "You mean Magnifico's information about the Mule was false?"

    "it was misleading. It was colored by pathological fear. The Mule is not the physical giant
    Magnifico thinks. He is more probably an ordinary man outside his mental powers. But if it
    amused him to appear a superman to poor Magnifico-" The psychologist shrugged. "In any
    case, Magnifico's information is no longer of importance."

    "What is, then?"

    But Mis shook himself loose and returned to his projector.

    "What is, then?" she repeated. "The Second Foundation?"

    The psychologist's eyes jerked towards her. "Have I told you anything about that? I don't
    remember telling you anything. I'm not ready yet. What have I told you?"

    "Nothing," said Bayta, intensely. "Oh, Galaxy, you've told me nothing, but I wish you would
    because I'm deathly tired. When will it be over?"

    Ebling Mis peered at her, vaguely rueful, "Well, now, my ... my dear, I did not mean to hurt you.

    I forget sometimes ... who my friends are. Sometimes it seems to me that I must not talk of all
    this. There's a need for secrecy - but from the Mule, not from you, my dear." He patted her
    shoulder with a weak amiability.

    She said, "What about the Second Foundation?"

    His voice was automatically a whisper, thin and sibilant. "Do you know the thoroughness with
    which Seldon covered his traces? The proceedings of the Seldon Convention would have been
    of no use to me at a as little as a month ago, before this strange insight came. Even now, it
    seems - tenuous. The papers put out by the Convention are often apparently unrelated; always
    obscure. More than once I wondered if the members of the Convention, themselves, knew all
    that was in Seldon's mind. Sometimes I think he used the Convention only as a gigantic front,
    and single-handed erected the structure-"

    "Of the Foundations?" urged Bayta.

    "Of the Second Foundation! Our Foundation was simple. But the Second Foundation was only
    a name. It was mentioned, but if there was any elaboration, it was hidden deep in the
    mathematics. There is still much I don't even begin to understand, but for seven days, the bits
    have been clumping together into a vague picture.

    "Foundation Number One was a world of physical scientists. It represented a concentration of
    the dying science of the Galaxy under the conditions necessary to make it live again. No
    psychologists were included. It was a peculiar distortion, and must have had a purpose. The
    usual explanation was that Seldon's psychohistory worked best where the individual working
    units - human beings - had no knowledge of what was coming, and could therefore react
    naturally to all situations. Do you follow me, my dear-"


    Yes, doctor.



    "Then listen carefully. Foundation Number Two was a world of mental scientists. It was the
    mirror image of our world. Psychology, not physics, was king." Triumphantly. "You see?"

    "I don't."

    "But think, Bayta, use your head. Hari Seldon knew that his psychohistory could predict only
    probabilities, and not certainties. There was always a margin of error, and as time passed that
    margin increases in geometric progression. Seldon would naturally guard as well as he could
    against it. Our Foundation was scientifically vigorous. It could conquer armies and weapons. It
    could pit force against force. But what of the mental attack of a mutant such as the Mule?"

    "That would be for the psychologists of the Second Foundation!" Bayta felt excitement rising
    within her.

    "Yes, yes, yes! Certainly!"

    "But they have done nothing so far."

    "Flow do you know they haven't?"

    Bayta considered that, "I don't. Do you have evidence that they have?"

    "No. There are many factors I know nothing of. The Second Foundation could not have been
    established full-grown, any more than we were. We developed slowly and grew in strength;
    they must have also. The stars know at what stage their strength is now. Are they strong
    enough to fight the Mule? Are they aware of the danger in the first place? Flave they capable
    leaders?"

    "But if they follow Seldon's plan, then the Mule must be beaten by the Second Foundation."

    "Ah," and Ebling Mis's thin face wrinkled thoughtfully, "is it that again? But the Second
    Foundation was a more difficult job than the First. Its complexity is hugely greater; and
    consequently so is its possibility of error. And if the Second Foundation should not beat the
    Mule, it is bad - ultimately bad. It is the end, may be, of the human race as we know it."

    "No.

    "Yes. If the Mule's descendants inherit his mental powers - You see? Flomo sapiens could not
    compete. There would be a new dominant race - a new aristocracy - with homo sapiens
    demoted to slave labor as an inferior race. Isn't that so?"

    "Yes, that is so."

    "And even if by some chance the Mule did not establish a dynasty, he would still establish a
    distorted new Empire upheld by his personal power only. It would die with his death; the Galaxy
    would be left where it was before he came, except that there would no longer be Foundations
    around which a real and healthy Second Empire could coalesce. It would mean thousands of
    years of barbarism. It would mean no end in sight."


    What can we do? Can we warn the Second Foundation?



    "We must, or they may go under through ignorance, which we can not risk. But there is no way
    of warning them."

    "No way?"

    "I don't know where they are located. They are 'at the other end of the Galaxy' but that is all,
    and there are millions of worlds to choose from."

    "But, Ebling, don't they say?" She pointed vaguely at the films that covered the table.

    "No, they don't. Not where I can find it - yet. The secrecy must mean something. There must
    be a reason-" A puzzled expression returned to his eyes. "But I wish you'd leave. I have
    wasted enough time, and it's growing short - it's growing short."

    He tore away, petulant and frowning.

    Magnifico's soft step approached. "Your husband is home, my lady."

    Ebling Mis did not greet the clown. He was back at his projector.

    That evening Toran, having listened, spoke, "And you think he's really right, Bay? You think he
    isn't-" He hesitated.

    "He is right, Torie. He's sick, I know that. The change that's come over him, the loss in weight,
    the way he speaks - he's sick. But as soon as the subject of the Mule or the Second
    Foundation, or anything he is working on, comes up, listen to him. He is lucid and clear as the
    sky of outer space. He knows what he's talking about. I believe him."

    "Then there's hope." It was half a question.

    "I ... I haven't worked it out. Maybe! Maybe not! I'm carrying a blaster from now on." The
    shiny-barreled weapon was in her hand as she spoke. "Just in case, Torie, just in case."

    "In case what?"

    Bayta laughed with a touch of hysteria, "Never mind. Maybe I'm a little crazy, too - like Ebling
    Mis."

    Ebling Mis at that time had seven days to live, and the seven days slipped by, one after the
    other, quietly.

    To Toran, there was a quality of stupor about them. The warming days and the dull silence
    covered him with lethargy. All life seemed to have lost its quality of action, and changed into an
    infinite sea of hibernation.

    Mis was a hidden entity whose burrowing work produced nothing and did not make itself
    known. He had barricaded himself. Neither Toran nor Bayta could see him. Only Magnifico's
    go-between characteristics were evidence of his existence. Magnifico, grown silent and
    thoughtful, with his tiptoed trays of food and his still, watchful witness in the gloom.

    Bayta was more and more a creature of herself. The vivacity died, the self-assured competence
    wavered. She, too, sought her own worried, absorbed company, and once Toran bad come



    upon her, fingering her blaster. She had put it away quickly, forced a smile.

    "What are you doing with it, Bay?"

    "Holding it. Is that a crime?"

    "You'll blow your fool head off."

    "Then I'll blow it off. Small loss!"

    Married life had taught Toran the futility of arguing with a female in a dark-brown mood. He
    shrugged, and left her.

    On the last day, Magnifico scampered breathless into their presence. He clutched at them,
    frightened. "The learned doctor calls for you. He is not well."

    And he wasn't well. He was in bed, his eyes unnaturally large, unnaturally bright. He was dirty,
    unrecognizable.

    "Ebling!" cried Bayta.

    "Let me speak," croaked the psychologist, lifting his weight to a thin elbow with an effort. "Let
    me speak. I am finished; the work I pass on to you. I have kept no notes; the scrap-figures I
    have destroyed. No other must know. All must remain in your minds."

    "Magnifico," said Bayta, with rough directness. "Go upstairs!"

    Reluctantly, the clown rose and took a backward step. His sad eyes were on Mis.

    Mis gestured weakly, "He won't matter; let him stay. Stay, Magnifico."

    The clown sat down quickly. Bayta gazed at the floor.

    Slowly, slowly, her lower lip caught in her teeth.

    Mis said, in a hoarse whisper, "I am convinced the Second Foundation can win, if it is not
    caught prematurely by the Mule. It has kept itself secret; the secrecy must be upheld; it has a
    purpose. You must go there; your information is vital ... may make all the difference. Do you
    hear me?"

    Toran cried in near-agony, "Yes, yes! Tell us how to get there, Ebling? Where is it?"

    "I can tell you," said the faint voice.

    He never did.

    Bayta, face frozen white, lifted her blaster and shot, with an echoing clap of noise. From the
    waist upward, Mis was not, and a ragged hole was in the wall behind. From numb fingers,
    Bayta's blaster dropped to the floor.



    26. END OF THE SEARCH

    There was not a word to be said. The echoes of the blast rolled away into the outer rooms and
    rumbled downward into a hoarse, dying whisper. Before its death, it had muffled the sharp
    clamor of Bayta's falling blaster, smothered Magnifico's high-pitched cry, drowned out Toran's
    inarticulate roar.

    There was a silence of agony.

    Bayta's head was bent into obscurity. A droplet caught the light as it fell. Bayta had never wept
    since her childhood.

    Toran's muscles almost cracked in their spasm, but he did not relax - he felt as if he would
    never unclench his teeth again. Magnifico's face was a faded, lifeless mask.

    Finally, from between teeth still tight, Toran choked out in an unrecognizable voice, "You're a
    Mule's woman, then. He got to you!"

    Bayta looked up, and her mouth twisted with a painful merriment, "/, a Mule's woman? That's
    ironic."

    She smiled - a brittle effort - and tossed her hair back. Slowly, her voice verged back to the
    normal, or something near it. "It's over, Toran; I can talk now. How much I will survive, I don't
    know. But I can start talking-"

    Toran's tension had broken of its own weight and faded into a flaccid dullness, "Talk about
    what, Bay? What's there to talk about?"

    "About the calamity that's followed us. We've remarked about it before, Torie. Don't you
    remember? How defeat has always bitten at our heels and never actually managed to nip us?
    We were on the Foundation, and it collapsed while the Independent Traders still fought - but
    we got out in time to go to Haven. We were on Haven, and it collapsed while the others still
    fought - and again we got out in time. We went to Neotrantor, and by now it's undoubtedly
    joined the Mule."

    Toran listened and shook his head, "I don't understand."

    "Torie, such things don't happen in real life. You and I are insignificant people; we don't fall from
    one vortex of politics into another continuously for the space of a year - unless we carry the
    vortex with us. Unless we carry the source of infection with us! Now do you see?"

    Toran's lips tightened. His glance fixed horribly upon the bloody remnants of what had once
    been a human, and his eyes sickened.

    "Let's get out of here, Bay. Let's get out into the open."

    It was cloudy outside. The wind scudded about them in drab spurts and disordered Bayta's hair.
    Magnifico had crept after them and now he hovered at the edge of their conversation.

    Toran said tightly, "You killed Ebling Mis because you believed him to be the focus of



    infection?" Something in her eyes struck him. He whispered, "He was the Mule?" He did not -
    could not - believe the implications of his own words.

    Bayta laughed sharply, "Poor Ebling the Mule? Galaxy, no! I couldn't have killed him if he were
    the Mule. He would have detected the emotion accompanying the move and changed it for me
    to love, devotion, adoration, terror, whatever he pleased. No, I killed Ebling because he was not
    the Mule. I killed him because he knew where the Second Foundation was, and in two seconds
    would have told the Mule the secret."

    "Would have told the Mule the secret," Toran repeated stupidly. "Told the Mule-"

    And then he emitted a sharp cry, and turned to stare in horror at the clown, who might have
    been crouching unconscious there for the apparent understanding he had of what he heard.

    "Not Magnifico?" Toran whispered the question.

    "Listen!" said Bayta. "Do you remember what happened on Neotrantor? Oh, think for yourself,
    Torie-"

    But he shook his head and mumbled at her.

    She went on, wearily, "A man died on Neotrantor. A man died with no one touching him. Isn't
    that true? Magnifico played on his Visi-Sonor and when he was finished, the crown prince was
    dead. Now isn't that strange? Isn't it queer that a creature afraid of everything, apparently
    helpless with terror, has the capacity to kill at will."

    "The music and the light-effects," said Toran, "have a profound emotional effect-"

    "Yes, an emotional effect. A pretty big one. Emotional effects happen to be the Mule's specialty.
    That, I suppose, can be considered a coincidence. And a creature who can kill by suggestion is
    so full of fright. Well, the Mule tampered with his mind, supposedly, so that can be explained.
    But, Toran, I caught a little of that Visi-Sonor selection that killed the crown prince. Just a little -
    but it was enough to give me that same feeling of despair I had in the Time Vault and on
    Haven. Toran, I can't mistake that particular feeling."

    Toran's face was darkening. "I ... felt it, too. I forgot. I never thought-"

    "It was then that it first occurred to me. It was just a vague feeling - intuition, if you like. I had
    nothing to go on. And then Pritcher told us of the Mule and his mutation, and it was clear in a
    moment. It was the Mule who had created the despair in the Time Vault; it was Magnifico who
    had created the despair on Neotrantor. It was the same emotion. Therefore, the Mule and
    Magnifico were the same person. Doesn't it work out nicely, Torie? Isn't it just like an axiom in
    geometry - things equal to the same thing are equal to each other?"

    She was at the edge of hysteria, but dragged herself back to sobriety by main force. She
    continued, "The discovery scared me to death. If Magnifico were the Mule, he could know my
    emotions - and cure them for his own purposes. I dared not let him know. I avoided him.

    Luckily, he avoided me also; he was too interested in Ebling Mis. I planned killing Mis before he
    could talk. I planned it secretly - as secretly as I could - so secretly I didn't dare tell it to myself.



    "If I could have killed the Mule himself - But I couldn't take the chance. He would have noticed,
    and I would have lost everything."

    She seemed drained of emotion.

    Toran said harshly and with finality, "It's impossible. Look at the miserable creature. He the
    Mule? He doesn't even hear what we're saying."

    But when his eyes followed his pointing finger, Magnifico was erect and alert, his eyes sharp
    and darkly bright. His voice was without a trace of an accent, "I hear her, my friend. It is merely
    that I have been sitting here and brooding on the fact that with all my cleverness and
    forethought I could make a mistake, and lose so much."

    Toran stumbled backward as if afraid the clown might touch him or that his breath might
    contaminate him.

    Magnifico nodded, and answered the unspoken question. "I am the Mule."

    He seemed no longer a grotesque; his pipestem limbs, his beak of a nose lost their
    humor-compelling qualities. His fear was gone; his bearing was firm.

    He was in command of the situation with an ease born of usage.

    He said, tolerantly, "Seat yourselves. Go ahead; you might as well sprawl out and make
    yourselves comfortable. The game's over, and I'd like to tell you a story. It's a weakness of
    mine - I want people to understand me."

    And his eyes as he looked at Bayta were still the old, soft sad brown ones of Magnifico, the
    clown.

    "There is nothing really to my childhood," he began, plunging bodily into quick, impatient
    speech, "that I care to remember. Perhaps you can understand that. My meagerness is
    glandular; my nose I was born with. It was not possible for me to lead a normal childhood. My
    mother died before she saw me. I do not know my father. I grew up haphazard, wounded and
    tortured in mind, full of self-pity and hatred of others. I was known then as a queer child. All
    avoided me; most out of dislike; some out of fear. Queer incidents occurred - Well, never mind!
    Enough happened to enable Captain Pritcher, in his investigation of my childhood to realize
    that I was a mutant, which was more than / ever realized until I was in my twenties."

    Toran and Bayta listened distantly. The wash of his voice broke over them, seated on the
    ground as they were, unheeded almost. The clown - or the Mule - paced before them with little
    steps, speaking downward to his own folded arms.

    "The whole notion of my unusual power seems to have broken on me so slowly, in such
    sluggish steps. Even toward the end, I couldn't believe it. To me, men's minds are dials, with
    pointers that indicate the prevailing emotion. It is a poor picture, but how else can I explain it?
    Slowly, I learned that I could reach into those minds and turn the pointer to the spot I wished,
    that I could nail it there forever. And then it took even longer to realize that others couldn't.

    "But the consciousness of power came, and with it, the desire to make up for the miserable



    position of my earlier life. Maybe you can understand it. Maybe you can try to understand it. It
    isn't easy to be a freak - to have a mind and an understanding and be a freak. Laughter and
    cruelty! To be different! To be an outsider!

    "You've never been through it!"

    Magnifico looked up to the sky and teetered on the balls of his feet and reminisced stonily, "But
    I eventually did learn, and I decided that the Galaxy and I could take turns. Come, they had had
    their innings, and I had been patient about it - for twenty-two years. My turn! It would be up to
    the rest of you to take it! And the odds would be fair enough for the Galaxy. One of me!
    Quadrillions of them!"

    He paused to glance at Bayta swiftly. "But I had a weakness. I was nothing in myself. If I could
    gain power, it could only be by means of others. Success came to me through middlemen.
    Always! It was as Pritcher said. Through a pirate, I obtained my first asteroidal base of
    operations. Through an industrialist I got my first foothold on a planet. Through a variety of
    others ending with the warlord of Kalgan, I won Kalgan itself and got a navy. After that, it was
    the Foundation - and you two come into the story.

    "The Foundation," he said, softly, "was the most difficult task I had met. To beat it, I would have
    to win over, break down, or render useless an extraordinary proportion of its ruling class. I
    could have done it from scratch - but a short cut was possible, and I looked for it. After all, if a
    strong man can lift five hundred pounds, it does not mean that he is eager to do so
    continuously. My emotional control is not an easy task, I prefer not to use it, where not fully
    necessary. So I accepted allies in my first attack upon the Foundation.

    "As my clown, I looked for the agent, or agents, of the Foundation that must inevitably have
    been sent to Kalgan to investigate my humble self. I know now it was Han Pritcher I was
    looking for. By a stroke of fortune, I found you instead. I am a telepath, but not a complete one,
    and, my lady, you were from the Foundation. I was led astray by that. It was not fatal for
    Pritcher joined us afterward, but it was the starting point of an error that was fatal."

    Toran stirred for the first time. He spoke in an outraged tone, "Hold on, now. You mean that
    when I outfaced that lieutenant on Kalgan with only a stun pistol, and rescued you - that you
    had emotionally-controlled me into it." He was spluttering. "You mean I've been tampered with
    all along."

    A thin smile played on Magnifico's face. "Why not? You don't think it's likely? Ask yourself then
    - Would you have risked death for a strange grotesque you had never seen before, if you had
    been in your right mind? I imagine you were surprised at events in cold after-blood."

    "Yes," said Bayta, distantly, "he was. It's quite plain."

    "As it was," continued the Mule, "Toran was in no danger. The lieutenant had his own strict
    instructions to let us go. So the three of us and Pritcher went to the Foundation - and see how
    my campaign shaped itself instantly. When Pritcher was court-martialed and we were present, I
    was busy. The military judges of that trial later commanded their squadrons in the war. They
    surrendered rather easily, and my Navy won the battle of Horleggor, and other lesser affairs.



    "Through Pritcher, I met Dr. Mis, who brought me a Visi-Sonor, entirely of his own accord, and
    simplified my task immensely. Only it wasn't entirely of his own accord."

    Bayta interrupted, "Those concerts! I've been trying to fit them in. Now I see."

    "Yes," said Magnifico, "the Visi-Sonor acts as a focusing device. In a way, it is a primitive
    device for emotional control in itself. With it, I can handle people in quantity and single people
    more intensively. The concerts I gave on Terminus before it fell and Haven before it fell
    contributed to the general defeatism. I might have made the crown prince of Neotrantor very
    sick without the Visi-Sonor, but I could not have killed him. You see?

    "But it was Ebling Mis who was my most important find. He might have been-" Magnifico said it
    with chagrin, then hurried on, "There is a special facet to emotional control you do not know
    about. Intuition or insight or hunch-tendency, whatever you wish to call it, can be treated as an
    emotion. At least, I can treat it so. You don't understand it, do you?"

    He waited for no negative, "The human mind works at low efficiency. Twenty percent is the
    figure usually given. When, momentarily, there is a flash of greater power it is termed a hunch,
    or insight, or intuition. I found early that I could induce a continual use of high brain-efficiency. It
    is a killing process for the person affected, but it is useful. The nuclear field-depressor which I
    used in the war against the Foundation was the result of high-pressuring a Kalgan technician.
    Again I work through others.

    "Ebling Mis was the bull's-eye. His potentialities were high, and I needed him. Even before my
    war with the Foundation had opened, I had already sent delegates to negotiate with the Empire.
    It was at that time I began my search for the Second Foundation. Naturally, I didn't find it.
    Naturally, I knew that I must find it - and Ebling Mis was the answer. With his mind at high
    efficiency, he might possibly have duplicated the work of Hari Seldon.

    "Partly, he did. I drove him to the utter limit. The process was ruthless, but had to be completed.
    He was dying at the end, but he lived-" Again, his chagrin interrupted him. "He would have
    lived long enough. Together, we three could have gone onward to the Second Foundation. It
    would have been the last battle - but for my mistake."

    Toran stirred his voice to hardness, "Why do you stretch it out so? What was your mistake, and
    ... and have done with your speech."

    "Why, your wife was the mistake. Your wife was an unusual person. I had never met her like
    before in my life. I ... I-" Quite suddenly, Magnifico's voice broke. He recovered with difficulty.
    There was a grimness about him as he continued. "She liked me without my having to juggle
    her emotions. She was neither repelled by me nor amused by me. She liked me!

    "Don't you understand? Can't you see what that would mean to me? Never before had anyone
    - Well, I ... cherished that. My own emotions played me false, though I was master of all others.
    I stayed out of her mind, you see; I did not tamper with it. I cherished the natural feeling too
    greatly. It was my mistake - the first.

    "You, Toran, were under control. You never suspected me; never questioned me; never saw
    anything peculiar or strange about me. As for instance, when the 'Filian' ship stopped us. They



    knew our location, by the way, because I was in communication with them, as I've remained in
    communication with my generals at all times. When they stopped us, I was taken aboard to
    adjust Han Pritcher, who was on it as a prisoner. When I left, he was a colonel, a Mule's man,
    and in command. The whole procedure was too open even for you, Toran. Yet you accepted
    my explanation of the matter, which was full of fallacies. See what I mean?"

    Toran grimaced, and challenged him, "How did you retain communications with your generals?"

    "There was no difficulty to it. Hyperwave transmitters are easy to handle and eminently
    portable. Nor could I be detected in a real sense! Anyone who did catch me in the act would
    leave me with a slice gapped out of his memory. It happened, on occasion.

    "On Neotrantor, my own foolish emotions betrayed me again. Bayta was not under my control,
    but even so might never have suspected me if I had kept my head about the crown prince. His
    intentions towards Bayta - annoyed me.

    "I killed him. It was a foolish gesture. An unobtrusive flight would have served as well.

    "And still your suspicions would not have been certainties, if I had stopped Pritcher in his
    well-intentioned babbling, or paid less attention to Mis and more to you-" He shrugged.

    "That's the end of it?" asked Bayta.

    "That's the end."

    "What now, then?"

    "I'll continue with my program. That I'll find another as adequately brained and trained as Ebling
    Mis in these degenerate days, I doubt. I shall have to search for the Second Foundation
    otherwise. In a sense you have defeated me."

    And now Bayta was upon her feet, triumphant. "In a sense? Only in a sense? We have
    defeated you entirely! All your victories outside the Foundation count for nothing, since the
    Galaxy is a barbarian vacuum now. The Foundation itself is only a minor victory, since it wasn't
    meant to stop your variety of crisis. It's the Second Foundation you must beat - the Second
    Foundation - and it's the Second Foundation that will defeat you. Your only chance was to
    locate it and strike it before it was prepared. You won't do that now. Every minute from now on,
    they will be readier for you. At this moment, at this moment, the machinery may have started.
    You'll know - when it strikes you, and your short term of power will be over, and you'll be just
    another strutting conqueror, flashing quickly and meanly across the bloody face of history."

    She was breathing hard, nearly gasping in her vehemence, "And we've defeated you, Toran
    and I. I am satisfied to die."

    But the Mule's sad, brown eyes were the sad, brown, loving eyes of Magnifico. "I won't kill you
    or your husband. It is, after all, impossible for you two to hurt me further; and killing you won't
    bring back Ebling Mis. My mistakes were my own, and I take responsibility for them. Your
    husband and yourself may leave! Go in peace, for the sake of what I call - friendship."

    Then, with a sudden touch of pride, "And meanwhile I am still the Mule, the most powerful man



    in the Galaxy. I shall still defeat the Second Foundation."

    And Bayta shot her last arrow with a firm, calm certitude, "You won't! I have faith in the wisdom
    of Seldon yet. You shall be the last ruler of your dynasty, as well as the first."

    Something caught Magnifico. "Of my dynasty? Yes, I had thought of that, often. That I might
    establish a dynasty. That I might have a suitable consort."

    Bayta suddenly caught the meaning of the look in his eyes and froze horribly.

    Magnifico shook his head. "I sense your revulsion, but that's silly. If things were otherwise, I
    could make you happy very easily. It would be an artificial ecstasy, but there would be no
    difference between it and the genuine emotion. But things are not otherwise. I call myself the
    Mule - but not because of my strength - obviously-"

    He left them, never looking back.

    21 . THE ANSWER THAT SATISFIED

    22. THE ANSWER THAT WAS TRUE


    Prologue

    The First Galactic Empire had endured for tens of thousands of years. It had included all the
    planets of the Galaxy in a centralized rule, sometimes tyrannical, sometimes benevolent,
    always orderly. Human beings had forgotten that any other form of existence could be.

    All except Hari Seldon.

    Hari Seldon was the last great scientist of the First Empire. It was he who brought the science
    of psycho-history to its full development. Psycho-history was the quintessence of sociology, it
    was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations.

    The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs, Seldon found,
    could be treated statistically. The larger the mob, the greater the accuracy that could be
    achieved. And the size of the human masses that Seldon worked with was no less than the
    population of the Galaxy which in his time was numbered in the quintillions.

    It was Seldon, then, who foresaw, against all common sense and popular belief, that the
    brilliant Empire which seemed so strong was in a state of irremediable decay and decline. He
    foresaw (or he solved his equations and interpreted its symbols, which amounts to the same
    thing) that left to itself, the Galaxy would pass through a thirty thousand year period of misery
    and anarchy before a unified government would rise once more.

    He set about to remedy the situation, to bring about a state of affairs that would restore peace
    and civilization in a single thousand of years. Carefully, he set up two colonies of scientists that
    he called "Foundations." With deliberate intention, he set them up "at opposite ends of the
    Galaxy." One Foundation was set up in the full daylight of publicity. The existence of the other,


    the Second Foundation, was drowned in silence.

    In Foundation (Gnome, 1951) and Foundation and Empire (Gnome, 1952) are told the first
    three centuries of the history of the First Foundation. It began as a small community of
    Encyclopedists lost in the emptiness of the outer periphery of the Galaxy. Periodically, it faced
    a crisis in which the variables of human intercourse, of the social and economic currents of the
    time constricted about it. Its freedom to move lay along only one certain line and when it moved
    in that direction, a new horizon of development opened before it. All had been planned by Hari
    Seldon, long dead now.

    The First Foundation, with its superior science, took over the barbarized planets that
    surrounded it. It faced the anarchic Warlords that broke away from the dying Empire and beat
    them. It faced the remnant of the Empire itself under its last strong Emperor and its last strong
    General and beat it.

    Then it faced something which Hari Seldon could not foresee, the overwhelming power of a
    single human being, a Mutant. The creature known as the Mule was born with the ability to
    mold men's emotions and to shape their minds. His bitterest opponents were made into his
    devoted servants. Armies could not, would not fight him. Before him, the First Foundation fell
    and Seldon's schemes lay partly in ruins.

    There was left the mysterious Second Foundation, the goal of all searches. The Mule must find
    it to make his conquest of the Galaxy complete. The faithful of what was left of the First
    Foundation must find it for quite another reason. But where was it? That no one knew.

    This, then, is the story of the search for the Second Foundation!


    PART I

    SEARCH BY THE MULE


    1

    Two Men and the Mule

    THE MULE It was after the fall of the First Foundation that the constructive aspects of the
    Mule's regime took shape. After the definite break-up at the first Galactic Empire, it was he who
    first presented history with a unified volume at space truly imperial in scope. The earlier
    commercial empire at the fallen Foundation had been diverse and loosely knit, despite the
    impalpable backing at the predictions of psycho-history. It was not to be compared with the
    tightly controlled 'Union of Worlds' under the Mule, comprising as it did, one-tenth the volume of





    the Galaxy and one-fifteenth of its population. Particularly during the era of the so-called
    Search....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA *

    * All quotations from the Encyclopedia Galactica here reproduced are taken from the 1 1 6th
    Edition published in 1020 F.E. by the Encyclopedia Galactica Publishing Co., Terminus, with
    permission of the publishers.

    There is much more that the Encyclopedia has to say on the subject of the Mule and his Empire
    but almost all of it is not germane to the issue at immediate hand, and most of it is considerably
    too dry for our purposes in any case. Mainly, the article concerns itself at this point with the
    economic conditions that led to the rise of the "First Citizen of the Union" - the Mule's official
    title - and with the economic consequences thereof.

    If, at any time, the writer of the article is mildly astonished at the colossal haste with which the
    Mule rose from nothing to vast dominion in five years, he conceals it. If he is further surprised at
    the sudden cessation of expansion in favor of a five-year consolidation of territory, he hides the
    fact.

    We therefore abandon the Encyclopedia and continue on our own path for our own purposes
    and take up the history of the Great Interregnum - between the First and Second Galactic
    Empires - at the end of that five years of consolidation.

    Politically, the Union is quiet. Economically, it is prosperous. Few would care to exchange the
    peace of the Mule's steady grip for the chaos that had preceded, On the worlds that five years
    previously had known the Foundation, there might be a nostalgic regret, but no more. The
    Foundation's leaders were dead, where useless; and Converted, where useful.

    And of the Converted, the most useful was Flan Pritcher, now lieutenant general.

    In the days of the Foundation, Flan Pritcher had been a captain and a member of the
    underground Democratic Opposition. When the Foundation fell to the Mule without a fight,
    Pritcher fought the Mule. Until, that is, he was Converted.

    The Conversion was not the ordinary one brought on by the power of superior reason. Flan
    Pritcher know that well enough. Fie had been changed because the Mule was a mutant with
    mental powers quite capable of adjusting the conditions of ordinary humans to suit himself. But
    that satisfied him completely. That was as it should be. The very contentment with the
    Conversion was a prime symptom of it, but Flan Pritcher was no longer even curious about the
    matter.

    And now that he was returning from his fifth major expedition into the boundlessness of the
    Galaxy outside the Union, it was with something approaching artless joy that the veteran
    spaceman and Intelligence agent considered his approaching audience with the "First Citizen."
    FHis hard face, gouged out of a dark, grainless wood that did not seem to be capable of smiling
    without cracking, didn't show it - but the outward indications were unnecessary. The Mule could
    see the emotions within, down to the smallest, much as an ordinary man could see the twitch of
    an eyebrow.



    Pritcher left his air car at the old vice-regal hangars and entered the palace grounds on foot as
    was required. He walked one mile along the arrowed highway - which was empty and silent.
    Pritcher knew that over the square miles of Palace grounds, there was not one guard, not one
    soldier, not one armed man.

    The Mule had need of no protection.

    The Mule was his own best, all-powerful protector.

    Pritcher's footsteps beat softly in his own cars, as the palace reared its gleaming, incredibly
    light and incredibly strong metallic walls before him in the daring, overblown, near-hectic arches
    that characterized the architecture of the Late Empire. It brooded strongly over the empty
    grounds, over the crowded city on the horizon.

    Within the palace was that one man - by himself - on whose inhuman mental attributes
    depended the new aristocracy, and the whole structure of the Union.

    The huge, smooth door swung massively open at the general's approach, and he entered. He
    stepped on to the wide, sweeping ramp that moved upward under him. He rose swiftly in the
    noiseless elevator. He stood before the small plain door of the Mule's own room in the highest
    glitter of the palace spires.

    It opened-

    Bail Channis was young, and Bail Channis was Unconverted. That is, in plainer language, his
    emotional make-up had been unadjusted by the Mule. It remained exactly as it had been
    formed by the original shape of its heredity and the subsequent modifications of his
    environment. And that satisfied him, too.

    At not quite thirty, he was in marvelously good odor in the capital. He was handsome and
    quick-witted - therefore successful in society. He was intelligent and self-possessed - therefore
    successful with the Mule. And he was thoroughly pleased at both successes.

    And now, for the first time, the Mule had summoned him to personal audience.

    His legs carried him down the long, glittering highway that led tautly to the sponge-aluminum
    spires that had been once the residence of the viceroy of Kalgan, who ruled under the old
    emperors; and that had been later the residence of the independent Princes of Kalgan, who
    ruled in their own name; and that was now the residence of the First Citizen of the Union, who
    ruled over an empire of his own.

    Channis hummed softly to himself. He did not doubt what this was all about. The Second
    Foundation, naturally! That all-embracing bogey, the mere consideration of which had thrown
    the Mule back from his policy of limitless expansion into static caution. The official term was -
    "consolidation."

    Now there were rumors - you couldn't stop rumors. The Mule was to begin the offensive once
    more. The Mule had discovered the whereabouts of the Second Foundation, and would attack
    The Mule had come to an agreement with the Second Foundation and divided the Galaxy. The
    Mule had decided the Second Foundation did not exist and would take over all the Galaxy.



    No use listing all the varieties one heard in the anterooms. It was not even the first time such
    rumors had circulated. But now they seemed to have more body in them, and all the free,
    expansive Souls Who thrived on war, military adventure, and political chaos and withered in
    times of stability and stagnant peace were joyful.

    Bail Channis was one of these. He did not fear the mysterious Second Foundation. For that
    matter, he did not fear the Mule, and boasted of it. Some, perhaps, who disapproved of one at
    once so young and so well-off, waited darkly for the reckoning with the gay ladies' man who
    employed his wit openly at the expense of the Mule's physical appearance and sequestered
    life. None dared join him and few dared laugh, but when nothing happened to him, his
    reputation rose accordingly.

    Channis was improvising words to the tune he was humming. Nonsense words with the
    recurrent refrain: "Second Foundation threatens the Nation and all of Creation."

    He was at the palace.

    The huge, smooth door swung massively open at his approach and he entered. He stepped on
    to the wide, sweeping ramp that moved upward under him. He rose swiftly in the noiseless
    elevator. He stood before the small plain door of the Mule's own room in the highest glitter of
    the palace spires.

    It opened-

    The man who had no name other than the Mule, and no title other than First Citizen looked out
    through the one-way transparency of the wall to the light and lofty city on the horizon.

    In the darkening twilight, the stars were emerging, and not one but owed allegiance to him.

    He smiled with fleeting bitterness at the thought. The allegiance they owed was to a personality
    few had ever seen.

    He was not a man to look at, the Mule - not a man to look at without derision. Not more than
    one hundred and twenty pounds was stretched out into his five-foot-eight length. His limbs were
    bony stalks that jutted out of his scrawniness in graceless angularity. And his thin face was
    nearly drowned out in the prominence of a fleshy beak that thrust three inches outward.

    Only his eyes played false with the general farce that was the Mule. In their softness - a
    strange softness for the Galaxy's greatest conqueror - sadness was never entirely subdued.

    In the city was to be found all the gaiety of a luxurious capital on a luxurious world. He might
    have established his capital on the Foundation, the strongest of his now-conquered enemies,
    but it was far out on the very rim of the Galaxy. Kalgan, more centrally located, with a long
    tradition as aristocracy's playground, suited him better - strategically.

    But in its traditional gaiety, enhanced by unheard-of prosperity, he found no peace.

    They feared him and obeyed him and, perhaps, even respected him - from a goodly distance.
    But who could look at him without contempt? Only those he had Converted. And of what value
    was their artificial loyalty? It lacked flavor. He might have adopted titles, and enforced ritual and



    invented elaborations, but even that would have changed nothing. Better - or at least, no worse

    - to be simply the First Citizen - and to hide himself.

    There was a sudden surge of rebellion within him - strong and brutal. Not a portion of the
    Galaxy must be denied him, For five years he had remained silent and buried here on Kalgan
    because of the eternal, misty, space-ridden menace of the unseen, unheard, unknown Second
    Foundation. Fie was thirty-two. Not old - but he felt old. His body, whatever its mutant mental
    powers, was physically weak.

    Every star! Every star he could see - and every star he couldnt see. It must all be his!

    Revenge on all. On a humanity of which he wasn't a part. On a Galaxy in which he didn't fit.

    The cool, overhead warning light flickered. Fie could follow the progress of the man who had
    entered the palace, and simultaneously, as though his mutant sense had been enhanced and
    sensitized in the lonely twilight, he felt the wash of emotional content touch the fibers of his
    brain.

    Fie recognized the identity without an effort. It was Pritcher.

    Captain Pritcher of the one-time Foundation. The Captain Pritcher who had been ignored and
    passed over by the bureaucrats of that decaying government. The Captain Pritcher whose job
    as petty spy he had wiped out and whom he had lifted from its slime. The Captain Pritcher
    whom he had made first colonel and then general; whose scope of activity he had made
    Galaxywide.

    The now-General Pritcher who was, iron rebel though he began, completely loyal. And yet with
    all that, not loyal because of benefits gained, not loyal out of gratitude, not loyal as a fair return

    - but loyal only through the artifice of Conversion.

    The Mule was conscious of that strong unalterable surface layer of loyalty and love that colored
    every swirl and eddy of the emotionality of Flan Pritcher - the layer he had himself implanted
    five years before. Far underneath there were the original traces of stubborn individuality,
    impatience of rule, idealism - but even he, himself, could scarcely detect them any longer.

    The door behind him opened, and he turned. The transparency of the wall faded to opacity, and
    the purple evening light gave way to the whitely blazing glow of atomic power.

    Flan Pritcher took the seat indicated. There was neither bowing, nor kneeling nor the use of
    honorifics in private audiences with the Mule. The Mule was merely "First Citizen." Fie was
    addressed as "sir." You sat in his presence, and you could turn your back on him if it so
    happened that you did.

    To Flan Pritcher this was all evidence of the sure and confident power of the man. Fie was
    warmly satisfied with it.

    The Mule said: "Your final report reached me yesterday. I can't deny that I find it somewhat
    depressing, Pritcher."

    The general's eyebrows closed upon each other: "Yes, I imagine so - but I don't see to what



    other conclusions I could have come. There just isn't any Second Foundation, sir."

    Arid the Mule considered and then slowly shook his head, as he had done many a time before:
    "There's the evidence of Ebling Mis. There is always the evidence of Ebling Mis."

    It was not a new story. Pritcher said without qualification: "Mis may have been the greatest
    psychologist of the Foundation, but he was a baby compared to Hari Seldon. At the time he
    was investigating Seldon's works, he was under the artificial stimulation of your own brain
    control. You may have pushed him too far. Fie might have been wrong. Sir, he must have been
    wrong."

    The Mule sighed, his lugubrious face thrust forward on its thin stalk of a neck. "If only he had
    lived another minute. Fie was on the point of telling me where the Second Foundation was. Fie
    knew, I'm telling you. I need not have retreated. I need not have waited and waited. So much
    time lost. Five years gone for nothing."

    Pritcher could not have been censorious over the weak longing of his ruler; his controlled
    mental make-up forbade that. Fie was disturbed instead; vaguely uneasy. Fie said: "But what
    alternative explanation can there possibly be, sir? Five times I've gone out. You yourself have
    plotted the routes. And I've left no asteroid unturned. It was three hundred years ago that FHari
    Seldon of the old Empire supposedly established two Foundations to act as nuclei of a new
    Empire to replace the dying old one. One hundred years after Seldon, the First Foundation -
    the one we know so well - was known through all the Periphery. One hundred fifty years after
    Seldon - at the time of the last battle with the old Empire - it was known throughout the Galaxy.
    And now it's three hundred years - and where should this mysterious Second be? In no eddy of
    the Galactic stream has it been heard of."

    "Ebling Mis said it kept itself secret. Only secrecy can turn its weakness to strength."

    "Secrecy as deep as this is past possibility without nonexistence as well."

    The Mule looked up, large eyes sharp and wary. "No. It does exist." A bony finger pointed
    sharply. "There is going to be a slight change in tactics."

    Pritcher frowned. "You plan to leave yourself? I would scarcely advise it."

    "No, of course not. You will have to go out once again - one last time. But with another in joint
    command."

    There was a silence, and Pritcher's voice was hard, "Who, Sir?"

    "There's a young man here in Kalgan. Bail Channis."

    "I've never heard of him, Sir."

    "No, I imagine not. But he's got an agile mind, he's ambitious - and he's not Converted."

    Pritcher's long jaw trembled for a bare instant, "I fail to see the advantage in that."

    "There is one, Pritcher. You're a resourceful and experienced man. You have given me good
    service. But you are Converted. Your motivation is simply an enforced and helpless loyalty to



    myself. When you lost your native motivations, you lost something, some subtle drive, that I
    cannot possibly replace."

    "I don't feel that, Sir," said Pritcher grimly. "I recall myself quite well as I was in the days when I
    was an enemy of yours. I feel none the inferior."

    "Naturally not," and the Mule’s mouth twitched into a smile. "Your judgment in this matter is
    scarcely objective. This Channis, now, is ambitious - for himself. He is completely trustworthy -
    out of no loyalty but to himself. He knows that it is on my coattails that he rides and he would do
    anything to increase my power that the ride might be long and far and that the destination might
    be glorious. If he goes with you, there is just that added push behind his seeking - that push for
    himself.'

    "Then," said Pritcher. still insistent, "why not remove my own Conversion, if you think that will
    improve me. I can scarcely be mistrusted, now."

    "That never, Pritcher. While you are within arm's reach, or blaster reach, of myself, you will
    remain firmly held in Conversion. If I were to release you this minute, I would be dead the next."

    The general's nostrils flared. "I am hurt that you should think so."

    "I don't mean to hurt you, but it is impossible for you to realize what your feelings would be if
    free to form themselves along the lines of your natural motivation. The human mind resents
    control. The ordinary human hypnotist cannot hypnotize a person against his will for that
    reason. I can, because I'm not a hypnotist, and, believe me, Pritcher, the resentment that you
    cannot show and do not even know you possess is something I wouldn't want to face."

    Pritcher's head bowed. Futility wrenched him and left him gray and haggard inside. He said with
    an effort, "But how can you trust this man. I mean, completely - as you can trust me in my
    Conversion."

    "Well, I suppose I can't entirely. That is why you must go with him. You see, Pritcher," and the
    Mule buried himself in the large armchair against the soft back of which he looked like an
    angularly animated toothpick, "if he should stumble on the Second Foundation - if it should
    occur to him that an arrangement with them might be more profitable than with me - You
    understand?"

    A profoundly satisfied light blazed in Pritcher's eyes. "That is better, Sir."

    "Exactly. But remember, he must have a free rein as far as possible."

    "Certainly."

    "And ... uh ... Pritcher. The young man is handsome, pleasant and extremely charming. Don't
    let him fool you. He's a dangerous and unscrupulous character. Don't get in his way unless
    you're prepared to meet him properly. That's all."

    The Mule was alone again. He let the lights die and the wall before him kicked to transparency
    again. The sky was purple now, and the city was a smudge of light on the horizon.

    What was it all for? And if he were the master of all there was - what then? Would it really stop



    men like Pritcher. from being straight and tall, self-confident, strong? Would Bail Channis lose
    his looks? Would he himself be other than he was?

    He cursed his doubts. What was he really after?

    The cool, overhead warning light flickered. He could follow the progress of the man who had
    entered the palace and, almost against his will, he felt the soft wash of emotional content touch
    the fibers of his brain.

    He recognized the identity without an effort. It was Channis. Here the Mule saw no uniformity,
    but the primitive diversity of a strong mind, untouched and unmolded except by the manifold
    disorganizations of the Universe. It writhed in floods and waves. There was caution on the
    surface, a thin, smoothing effect, but with touches of cynical ribaldry in the hidden eddies of it.
    And underneath there was the strong flow of self-interest and self-love, with a gush of cruel
    humor here and there, and a deep, still pool of ambition underlying all.

    The Mule felt that he could reach out and dam the current, wrench the pool from its basin and
    turn it in another course, dry up one flow and begin another. But what of it? If he could bend
    Channis’ curly head in the profoundest adoration, would that change his own grotesquerie that
    made him shun the day and love the night, that made him a recluse inside an empire that was
    unconditionally big?

    The door behind him opened, and he turned. The transparency of the wall faded to opacity, and
    the darkness gave way to the whitely blazing artifice of atomic power.

    Bail Channis sat down lightly and said: "This is a not-quite-unexpected honor, sir."

    The Mule rubbed his proboscis with all four fingers at once and sounded a bit irritable in his
    response. "Why so, young man?"

    "A hunch, I suppose. Unless I want to admit that I've been listening to rumors."

    "Rumors? Which one of the several dozen varieties are you referring to?"

    "Those that say a renewal of the Galactic Offensive is being planned. It is a hope with me that
    such is true and that I might play an appropriate part."

    "Then you think there is a Second Foundation?"

    "Why not? It would make things so much more interesting."

    "And you find interest in it as well?"

    "Certainly. In the very mystery of it! What better subject could you find for conjecture? The
    newspaper supplements are full of nothing else lately - which is probably significant. The
    Cosmos had one of its feature writers compose a weirdie about a world consisting of beings of
    pure mind - the Second Foundation, you see - who had developed mental force to energies
    large enough to compete with any known to physical science. Spaceships could be blasted
    light-years away, planets could be turned out of their orbits-"

    "Interesting. Yes. But do you have any notions on the subject? Do you subscribe to this



    mind-power notion?'

    "Galaxy, no! Do you think creatures like that would stay on their own planet? No, sir. I think the
    Second Foundation remains hidden because it is weaker than we think."

    "In that case, I can explain myself very easily. How would you like to head an expedition to
    locate the Second Foundation?"

    For a moment Channis seemed caught up by the sudden rush of events at just a little greater
    speed than he was prepared for. His tongue had apparently skidded to a halt in a lengthening
    silence.

    The Mule said dryly: "Well?"

    Channis corrugated his forehead. "Certainly. But where am I to go? Have you any information
    available?"

    "General Pritcher will be with you-"

    "Then I'm not to head it?"

    "Judge for yourself when I'm done. Listen, you're not of the Foundation. You're a native of
    Kalgan, aren't you? Yes. Well, then, your knowledge of the Seldon plan may be vague. When
    the first Galactic Empire was falling, Hari Seldon and a group of psychohistorians, analyzing the
    future course of history by mathematical tools no longer available in these degenerate times,
    set up two Foundations, one at each end of the Galaxy, in such a way that the economic and
    sociological forces that were slowly evolving, would make them serve as foci for the Second
    Empire. Hari Seldon planned on a thousand years to accomplish that - and it would have taken
    thirty thousand without the Foundations. But he couldn't count on me. I am a mutant and I am
    unpredictable by psychohistory which can only deal with the average reactions of numbers. Do
    you understand?"

    "Perfectly, sir. But how does that involve me?'

    "You'll understand shortly. I intend to unite the Galaxy now - and reach Seldon's thousand-year
    goal in three hundred. One Foundation - the world of physical scientists - is still flourishing,
    under me. Under the prosperity and order of the Union, the atomic weapons they have
    developed are capable of dealing with anything in the Galaxy - except perhaps the Second
    Foundation. So I must know more about it. General Pritcher is of the definite opinion that it
    does not exist at all. I know otherwise."

    Channis said delicately: "How do you know, sir?"

    And the Mule's words were suddenly liquid indignation: "Because minds under my control have
    been interfered with. Delicately! Subtly! But not so subtly that I couldn't notice. And these
    interferences are increasing, and hitting valuable men at important times. Do you wonder now
    that a certain discretion has kept me motionless these years?

    "That is your importance. General Pritcher is the best man left me, so he is no longer safe. Of
    course, he does not know that. But you are Unconverted and therefore not instantly detectable



    as a Mule's man. You may fool the Second Foundation longer than one of my own men would -
    perhaps just sufficiently longer. Do you understand?"

    "Um-m-m. Yes. But pardon me, sir, if I question you. How are these men of yours disturbed, so
    that I might detect change in General Pritcher, in case any occurs. Are they Unconverted
    again? Do they become disloyal?"

    "No. I told you it was subtle. It's more disturbing than that, because its harder to detect and
    sometimes I have to wait before acting, uncertain whether a key man is being normally erratic
    or has been tampered with. Their loyalty is left intact, but initiative and ingenuity are rubbed out.
    I'm left with a perfectly normal person, apparently, but one completely useless. In the last year,
    six have been so treated. Six of my best." A corner of his mouth lifted. "They're in charge of
    training bases now - and my most earnest wishes go with them that no emergencies come up
    for them to decide upon."

    "Suppose, sir ... suppose it were not the Second Foundation. What if it were another, such as
    yourself - another mutant?"

    "The planning is too careful, too long range. A single man would be in a greater hurry. No, it is a
    world, and you are to be my weapon against it."

    Channis' eyes shone as he said: "I'm delighted at the chance."

    But the Mule caught the sudden emotional upwelling. He said: "Yes, apparently it occurs to you,
    that you will perform a unique service, worthy of a unique reward - perhaps even that of being
    my successor. Quite so. But there are unique punishments, too, you know. My emotional
    gymnastics are not confined to the creation of loyalty alone."

    And the little smile on his thin lips was grim, as Channis leaped out of his seat in horror.

    For just an instant, just one, flashing instant, Channis had felt the pang of an overwhelming
    grief close over him. It had slammed down with a physical pain that had blackened his mind
    unbearably, and then lifted. Now nothing was left but the strong wash of anger.

    The Mule said: "Anger won't help ... yes, you're covering it up now, aren't you? But I can see it.
    So just remember - that sort of business can be made more intense and kept up. I've killed
    men by emotional control, and there's no death crueler."

    He paused: "That's all!"

    The Mule was alone again. He let the lights die and the wall before him kicked to transparency
    again. The sky was black, and the rising body of the Galactic Lens was spreading its
    bespanglement across the velvet depths of space.

    All that haze of nebula was a mass of stars so numerous that they melted one into the other
    and left nothing but a cloud of light.

    And all to be his—

    And now but one last arrangement to make, and he could sleep.



    FIRST INTERLUDE


    The Executive Council of the Second Foundation was in session. To us they are merely voices.
    Neither the exact scene of the meeting nor the identity of those present are essential at the
    point.

    Nor, strictly speaking, can we even consider an exact reproduction of any part of the session -
    unless we wish to sacrifice completely even the minimum comprehensibility we have a right to
    expect.

    We deal here with psychologists - and not merely psychologists. Let us say, rather, scientists
    with a psychological orientation. That is, men whose fundamental conception of scientific
    philosophy is pointed in an entirely different direction from all of the orientations we know. The
    "psychology" of scientists brought up among the axioms deduced from the observational habits
    of physical science has only the vaguest relationship to PSYCFIOLOGY.

    Which is about as far as I can go in explaining color to a blind man - with myself as blind as the
    audience.

    The point being made is that the minds assembled understood thoroughly the workings of each
    other, not only by general theory but by the specific application over a long period of these
    theories to particular individuals. Speech as known to us was unnecessary. A fragment of a
    sentence amounted almost to long-winded redundancy. A gesture, a grunt, the curve of a facial
    line - even a significantly timed pause yielded informational juice.

    The liberty is taken, therefore, of freely translating a small portion of the conference into the
    extremely specific word-combinations necessary to minds oriented from childhood to a physical
    science philosophy, even at the risk of losing the more delicate nuances.

    There was one "voice" predominant, and that belonged to the individual known simply as the
    First Speaker.

    Fie said: "It is apparently quite definite now as to what stopped the Mule in his first mad rush. I
    can't say that the matter reflects credit upon ... well, upon the organization of the situation.
    Apparently, he almost located us, by means of the artificially heightened brain-energy of what
    they call a 'psychologist' on the First Foundation. This psychologist was killed just before he
    could communicate his discovery to the Mule. The events leading to that killing were completely
    fortuitous for all calculations below Phase Three. Suppose you take over."

    It was the Fifth Speaker who was indicated by an inflection of the voice. Fie said, in grim
    nuances: "It is certain that the situation was mishandled. We are, of course, highly vulnerable
    under mass attack, particularly an attack led by such a mental phenomenon as the Mule.

    Shortly after he first achieved Galactic eminence with the conquest of the First Foundation, half
    a year after to be exact, he was on Trantor. Within another half year he would have been here
    and the odds would have been stupendously against us - 96.3 plus or minus 0.05% to be
    exact. We have spent considerable time analyzing the forces that stopped him. We know, of
    course, what was driving him on so in the first place. The internal ramifications of his physical
    deformity and mental uniqueness are obvious to all of us. Flowever, it was only through
    penetration to Phase Three that we could determine - after the fact- tbe possibility of his



    anomalous action in the presence of another human being who had an honest affection for him.

    "And since such an anomalous action would depend upon the presence of such another human
    being at the appropriate time, to that extent the whole affair was fortuitous. Our agents are
    certain that it was a girl that killed the Mule's psychologist - a girl for whom the Mule felt trust
    out of sentiment, and whom he, therefore, did not control mentally - simply because she liked
    him.

    "Since that event - and for those who want the details, a mathematical treatment of the subject
    has been drawn up for the Central Library - which warned us, we have held the Mule off by
    unorthodox methods with which we daily risk Seldon's entire scheme of history. That is all."

    The First Speaker paused an instant to allow the individuals assembled to absorb the full
    implications. He said: "The situation is then highly unstable. With Seldon's original scheme bent
    to the fracture point - and I must emphasize that we have blundered badly in this whole matter,
    in our horrible lack of foresight - we are faced with an irreversible breakdown of the Plan. Time
    is passing us by. I think there is only one solution left us - and even that is risky.

    "We must allow the Mule to find us - in a sense."

    Another pause, in which he gathered the reactions, then: "I repeat - in a sense!"

    Two Men without the Mule

    The ship was in near-readiness. Nothing lacked, but the destination. The Mule had suggested a
    return to Trantor - the world that was the bulk of an incomparable Galactic metropolis of the
    hugest Empire mankind had ever known - the dead world that had been capital of all the stars.

    Pritcher disapproved. It was an old path - sucked dry.

    He found Bail Channis in the ship's navigation room. The young man's curly hair was just
    sufficiently disheveled to allow a single curl to droop over the forehead - as if it had been
    carefully placed there - and even teeth showed in a smile that matched it. Vaguely, the stiff
    officer felt himself harden against the other.

    Channis' excitement was evident, "Pritcher, it's too far a coincidence."

    The general said coldly: "I’m not aware of the subject of conversation."

    "Oh- Well, then drag up a chair, old man, and let’s get into it. I've been going over your notes. I
    find them excellent."

    "How ... pleasant that you do."

    "But I’m wondering if you've come to the conclusions I have. Have you ever tried analyzing the
    problem deductively? I mean, it's all very well to comb the stars at random, and to have done all
    you did in five expeditions is quite a bit of star-hopping. That's obvious. But have you calculated



    how long it would take to go through every known world at this rate?"

    "Yes. Several times," Pritcher felt no urge to meet the young man halfway, but there was the
    importance of filching the other's mind - the other's uncontrolled, and hence, unpredictable,
    mind.

    "Well, then, suppose we're analytical about it and try to decide just what we're looking for?"

    "The Second Foundation," said Pritcher, grimly.

    "A Foundation of psychologists," corrected Channis, "who are is weak in physical science as
    the First Foundation was weak in psychology. Well, you're from the First Foundation, which I'm
    not. The implications are probably obvious to you. We must find a world which rules by virtue of
    mental skills, and yet which is very backwards scientifically."

    "Is that necessarily so?" questioned Pritcher, quietly. "Our own ‘Union of Worlds' isn't
    backwards scientifically, even though our ruler owes his strength to his mental powers."

    "Because he has the skills of the First Foundation to draw upon," came the slightly impatient
    answer, "and that is the only such reservoir of knowledge in the Galaxy. The Second
    Foundation must live among the dry crumbs of the broken Galactic Empire. There are no
    pickings there."

    "So then you postulate mental power sufficient to establish their rule over a group of worlds and
    physical helplessness as well?"

    "Comparative physical helplessness. Against the decadent neighboring areas, they are
    competent to defend themselves. Against the resurgent forces of the Mule, with his background
    of a mature atomic economy, they cannot stand. Else, why is their location so well-hidden, both
    at the start by the founder, Hari Seldon, and now by themselves. Your own First Foundation
    made no secret of its existence and did not have it made for them, when they were an
    undefended single city on a lonely planet three hundred years ago."

    The smooth lines of Pritcher's dark face twitched sardonically. 'And now that you've finished
    your deep analysis, would you like a list of all the kingdoms, republics, planet states and
    dictatorships of one sort or another in that political wilderness out there that correspond to your
    description and to several factors besides?"

    "All this has been considered then?" Channis lost none of his brashness.

    "You won't find it here, naturally, but we have a completely worked out guide to the political
    units of the Opposing Periphery. Really, did you suppose the Mule would work entirely
    hit-and-miss?"

    "Well, then" and the young man's voice rose in a burst of energy, "what of the Oligarchy of
    Tazenda?"

    Pritcher touched his ear thoughtfully, "Tazenda? Oh, I think I know it. They're not in the
    Periphery, are they? It seems to me they're fully a third of the way towards the center of the
    Galaxy."



    Yes. What of that?


    "The records we have place the Second Foundation at the other end of the Galaxy. Space
    knows it's the only thing we have to go on. Why talk of Tazenda anyway? Its angular deviation
    from the First Foundation radian is only about one hundred ten to one hundred twenty degrees
    anyway. Nowhere near one hundred eighty."

    "There's another point in the records. The Second Foundation was established at 'Star's End.'"
    "No such region in the Galaxy has ever been located."

    "Because it was a local name, suppressed later for greater secrecy. Or maybe one invented for
    the purpose by Seldon and his group. Yet there's some relationship between 'Star's End' and
    'Tazenda,' don't you think?"

    "A vague similarity in sound? Insufficient."

    'Flave you ever been there?"

    "No."

    "Yet it is mentioned in your records."

    "Where? Oh, yes, but that was merely to take on food and water. There was certainly nothing
    remarkable about the world."

    "Did you land at the ruling planet? The center of government?"

    "I couldn't possibly say."

    Channis brooded about it under the other's cold gaze. Then, "Would you look at the Lens with
    me for a moment?"

    "Certainly."

    The Lens was perhaps the newest feature of the interstellar cruisers of the day. Actually, it was
    a complicated calculating machine which could throw on a screen a reproduction of the night
    sky as seen from any given point of the Galaxy.

    Channis adjusted the co-ordinate points and the wall lights of the pilot room were extinguished.
    In the dim red light at the control board of the Lens, Channis' face glowed ruddily. Pritcher sat in
    the pilot seat, long legs crossed, face lost in the gloom.

    Slowly, as the induction period passed, the points of light brightened on the screen. And then
    they were thick and bright with the generously populated star-groupings of the Galaxy's center.

    "This," explained Channis, "is the winter night-sky as seen from Trantor. That is the important
    point that, as far as I know, has been neglected so far in your search. All intelligent orientation
    must start from Trantor as zero point. Trantor was the capital of the Galactic Empire. Even
    more so scientifically and culturally, than politically. And, therefore, the significance of any
    descriptive name should stem, nine times out of ten, from a Trantorian orientation. You'll
    remember in this connection that, although Seldon was from Helicon, towards the Periphery,



    his group worked on Trantor itself."

    "What is it you're trying to show me?" Pritcher's level voice plunged icily into the gathering
    enthusiasm of the other.

    "The map will explain it. Do you see the dark nebula?" The shadow of his arm fell upon the
    screen, which took on the bespanglement of the Galaxy. The pointing finger ended on a tiny
    patch of black that seemed a hole in the speckled fabric of light. "The stellagraphical records
    call it Pelot's Nebula. Watch it. I'm going to expand the image."

    Pritcher had watched the phenomenon of Lens Image expansion before but he still caught his
    breath. It was like being at the visiplate of a spaceship storming through a horribly crowded
    Galaxy without entering hyperspace. The stars diverged towards them from a common center,
    flared outwards and tumbled off the edge of the screen. Single points became double, then
    globular. Hazy patches dissolved into myriad points. And always that illusion of motion.

    Channis spoke through it all, "You'll notice that we are moving along the direct line from Trantor
    to Pelot's Nebula, so that in effect we are still looking at a stellar orientation equivalent to that of
    Trantor. There is probably a slight error because of the gravitic deviation of light that I haven't
    the math to calculate for, but I'm sure it can't be significant."

    The darkness was spreading over the screen. As the rate of magnification slowed, the stars
    slipped off the four ends of the screen in a regretful leave-taking. At the rims of the growing
    nebula, the brilliant universe of stars shone abruptly in token for that light which was merely
    hidden behind the swirling unradiating atom fragments of sodium and calcium that filled cubic
    parsecs of space.

    And Channis pointed again, "This has been called 'The Mouth' by the inhabitants of that region
    of space. And that is significant because it is only from the Trantorian orientation that it looks
    like a mouth." What he indicated was a rift in the body of the Nebula, shaped like a ragged,
    grinning mouth in profile, outlined by the glazing glory of the starlight with which it was filled.

    "Follow The Mouth.'" said Channis. "Follow 'The Mouth' towards the gullet as it narrows down to
    a thin, splintering line of light.

    Again the screen expanded a trifle, until the Nebula stretched away from "The Mouth" to block
    off all the screen but that narrow trickle and Channis' finger silently followed it down, to where it
    straggled to a halt, and then, as his finger continued moving onward, to a spot where one single
    star sparked lonesomely; and there his finger halted, for beyond that was blackness,
    unrelieved.

    "'Star's End,'" said the young man, simply. "The fabric of the Nebula is thin there and the light of
    that one star finds its way through in just that one direction - to shine on Trantor."

    "You're tying to tell me that-" the voice of the Mule's general died in suspicion.

    "I'm not trying. That is Tazenda - Star's End."

    The lights went on. The Lens flicked off. Pritcher reached Channis in three long strides, "What
    made you think of this?"



    And Channis leaned back in his chair with a queerly puzzled expression on his face. "It was
    accidental. I'd like to take intellectual credit for this, but it was only accidental. In any case,
    however it happens, it fits. According to our references, Tazenda is an oligarchy. It rules
    twenty-seven inhabited planets. It is not advanced scientifically. And most of all, it is an obscure
    world that has adhered to a strict neutrality in the local politics of that stellar region, and is not
    expansionist. I think we ought to see it."

    "Have you informed the Mule of this?"

    "No. Nor shall we. We're in space now, about to make the first hop."

    Pritcher, in sudden horror, sprang to the visiplate. Cold space met his eyes when he adjusted it.
    He gazed fixedly at the view, then turned. Automatically, his hand reached for the hard,
    comfortable curve of the butt of his blaster.

    "By whose order?"

    "By my order, general"- it was the first time Channis had ever used the other's title -"while I
    was engaging you here. You probably felt no acceleration, because it came at the moment I
    was expanding the field of the Lens and you undoubtedly imagined it to be an illusion of the
    apparent star motion."

    "Why? Just what are you doing? What was the point of your nonsense about Tazenda, then?"

    "That was no nonsense. I was completely serious. We're going there. We left today because
    we were scheduled to leave three days from now. General, you don't believe there is a Second
    Foundation, and I do. You are merely following the Mule's orders without faith; I recognize a
    serious danger. The Second Foundation has now had five years to prepare. How they've
    prepared, I don't know, but what if they have agents on Kalgan. If I carry about in my mind the
    knowledge of the whereabouts of the Second Foundation, they may discover that. My life might
    be no longer safe, and I have a great affection for my life. Even on a thin and remote possibility
    such as that, I would rather play safe. So no one knows of Tazenda but you, and you found out
    only after we were out in space. And even so, there is the question of the crew." Channis was
    smiling again, ironically, in obviously complete control of the situation.

    Pritcher's hand fell away from his blaster, and for a moment a vague discomfort pierced him.
    What kept him from action? What deadened him ? There was a time when he was a rebellious
    and unpromoted captain of the First Foundation's commercial empire, when it would have been
    himself rather than Channis who would have taken prompt and daring action such as that. Was
    the Mule right? Was his controlled mind so concerned with obedience as to lose initiative? He
    felt a thickening despondency drive him down into a strange lassitude.

    He said, "Well done! However, you will consult me in the future before making decisions of this
    nature."

    The flickering signal caught his attention.

    "That's the engine room," said Channis, casually. "They warmed up on five minutes' notice and
    I asked them to let me know if there was any trouble. Want to hold the fort?"



    Pritcher nodded mutely, and cogitated in the sudden loneliness on the evils of approaching fifty.
    The visiplate was sparsely starred. The main body of the Galaxy misted one end. What if he
    were free of the Mule's influence-

    But he recoiled in horror at the thought.

    Chief Engineer Huxlani looked sharply at the young, ununiformed man who carried himself with
    the assurance of a Fleet officer and seemed to be in a position of authority. Huxlani, as a
    regular Fleet man from the days his chin had dripped milk, generally confused authority with
    specific insignia.

    But the Mule had appointed this man, and the Mule was, of course, the last word. The only
    word for that matter. Not even subconsciously did he question that. Emotional control went
    deep.

    He handed Channis the little oval object without a word.

    Channis hefted it, and smiled engagingly.

    "You're a Foundation man, aren't you, chief?"

    "Yes, sir. I served in the Foundation Fleet eighteen years before the First Citizen took over."
    "Foundation training in engineering?"

    "Qualified Technician, First Class - Central School on Anacreon."

    "Good enough. And you found this on the communication circuit, where I asked you to look?"
    "Yes, Sir."

    "Does it belong there?"

    "No, Sir."

    "Then what is it?"

    "A hypertracer, sir."

    "That's not enough. I'm not a Foundation man. What is it?"

    "It's a device to allow the ship to be traced through hyperspace."

    "In other words we can be followed anywhere."

    "Yes, Sir."

    "All right. It's a recent invention, isn't it? It was developed by one of the Research Institutes set
    up by the First Citizen, wasn't it?"

    "I believe so, Sir."

    "And its workings are a government secret. Right?"



    "I, believe so, Sir."

    "Yet here it is. Intriguing."

    Channis tossed the hypertracer methodically from hand to hand for a few seconds. Then,
    sharply, he held it out, "Take it, then, and put it back exactly where you found it and exactly how
    you found it. Understand? And then forget this incident. Entirely!"

    The chief choked down his near-automatic salute, turned sharply and left.

    The ship bounded through the Galaxy, its path a wide-spaced dotted line through the stars. The
    dots, referred to, were the scant stretches of ten to sixty light-seconds spent in normal space
    and between them stretched the hundred-and-up light-year gaps that represented the "hops"
    through hyperspace.

    Bail Channis sat at the control panel of the Lens and felt again the involuntary surge of
    near-worship at the contemplation of it.

    He was not a Foundation man and the interplay of forces at the twist of a knob or the breaking
    of a contact was not second nature to him.

    Not that the Lens ought quite to bore even a Foundation man. Within its unbelievably compact
    body were enough electronic circuits to pin- point accurately a hundred million separate stars in
    exact relationship to each other. And as if that were not a feat in itself, it was further capable of
    translating any given portion of the Galactic Field along any of the three spatial axes or to rotate
    any portion of the Field about a center.

    It was because of that, that the Lens had performed a near-revolution in interstellar travel. In
    the younger days of interstellar travel, the calculation of each "hop" through hyperspace meant
    any amount of work from a day to a week - and the larger portion of such work was the more or
    less precise calculation of "Ship's Position" on the Galactic scale of reference. Essentially that
    meant the accurate observation of at least three widely-spaced stars, the position of which, with
    reference to the arbitrary Galactic triple-zero, were known.

    And it is the word "known," that is the catch. To any who know the star field well from one
    certain reference point, stars are as individual as people. Jump ten parsecs, however, and not
    even your own sun is recognizable. It may not even be visible.

    The answer was, of course, spectroscopic analysis. For centuries, the main object of interstellar
    engineering was the analysis of the "light signature" of more and more stars in greater and
    greater detail. With this, and the growing precision of the "hop" itself, standard routes of travel
    through the Galaxy were adopted and interstellar travel became less of an art and more of a
    science.

    And yet, even under the Foundation with improved calculating machines and a new method of
    mechanically scanning the star field for a known "light signature," it sometimes took days to
    locate three stars and then calculate position in regions not previously familiar to the pilot.

    It was the Lens that changed all that. For one thing it required only a single known star. For
    another, even a space tyro such as Channis could operate it.



    The nearest sizable star at the moment was Vincetori, according to "hop" calculations, and on
    the visiplate now, a bright star was centered. Channis hoped that it was Vincetori.

    The field screen of the Lens was thrown directly next that of the visiplate and with careful
    fingers, Channis punched out the co-ordinates of Vincetori. He closed a relay, and the star field
    sprang to bright view. In it, too, a bright star was centered, but otherwise there seemed no
    relationship. He adjusted the Lens along the Z-Axis and expanded the Field to where the
    photometer showed both centered stars to be of equal brightness.

    Channis looked for a second star, sizably bright, on the visiplate and found one on the field
    screen to correspond. Slowly, he rotated the screen to similar angular deflection. He twisted his
    mouth and rejected the result with a grimace. Again he rotated and another bright star was
    brought into position, and a third. And then he grinned. That did it. Perhaps a specialist with
    trained relationship perception might have clicked first try, but he'd settle for three.

    That was the adjustment. In the final step, the two fields overlapped and merged into a sea of
    not-quite-rightness. Most of the stars were close doubles. But the fine adjustment did not take
    long. The double stars melted together, one field remained, and the "Ship's Position" could now
    be read directly off the dials. The entire procedure had taken less than half an hour.

    Channis found Han Pritcher in his private quarters. The general was quite apparently preparing
    for bed. He looked up.

    "News?"

    "Not particularly. We’ll be at Tazenda in another hop."

    "I know."

    "I don't want to bother you if you're turning in, but have you looked through the film we picked
    up in Cil?"

    Han Pritcher cast a disparaging look at the article in question, where it lay in its black case
    upon his low bookshelf, "Yes."

    "And what do you think?"

    "I think that if there was ever any science to History, it has been quite lost in this region of the
    Galaxy."

    Channis grinned broadly, "I know what you mean. Rather barren, isn't it?"

    "Not if you enjoy personal chronicles of rulers. Probably unreachable, I should say, in both
    directions. Where history concerns mainly personalities, the drawings become either black or
    white according to the interests of the writer. I find it all remarkably useless."

    "But there is talk about Tazenda. That's the point I tried to make when I gave you the film. It's
    the only one I could find that even mentioned them."

    "All right. They have good rulers and bad. They've conquered a few planets, won some battles,
    lost a few. There is nothing distinctive about them. I don't think much of your theory, Channis."



    "But you've missed a few points. Didn't you notice that they never formed coalitions? They
    always remained completely outside the politics of this corner of the star swarm. As you say,
    they conquered a few planets, but then they stopped - and that without any startling defeat of
    consequence. It's just as if they spread out enough to protect themselves, but not enough to
    attract attention."

    "Very well," came the unemotional response. "I have no objection to landing. At the worst - a
    little lost time."

    "Oh, no. At the worst - complete defeat. If it is the Second Foundation. Remember it would be
    a world of space-knows-how-many Mules."

    "What do you plan to do?"

    "Land on some minor subject planet. Find out as much as we can about Tazenda first, then
    improvise from that."

    "All right. No objection. If you don't mind now, I would like the light out."

    Channis left with a wave of his hand.

    And in the darkness of a tiny room in an island of driving metal lost in the vastness of space,
    General Flan Pritcher remained awake, following the thoughts that led him through such
    fantastic reaches.

    If everything he had so painfully decided were true - and how all the facts were beginning to fit
    - then Tazenda was the Second Foundation. There was no way out. But how? Flow?

    Could it be Tazenda? An ordinary world? One without distinction? A slum lost amid the
    wreckage of an Empire? A splinter among the fragments? Fie remembered, as from a distance,
    the Mule's shriveled face and his thin voice as he used to speak of the old Foundation
    psychologist, Ebling Mis, the one man who had - maybe - learned the secret of the Second
    Foundation.

    Pritcher recalled the tension of the Mule's words: "It was as if astonishment had overwhelmed
    Mis. It was as though something about the Second Foundation had surpassed all his
    expectations, had driven in a direction completely different from what he might have assumed.

    If I could only have read his thoughts rather than his emotions. Yet the emotions were plain -
    and above everything else was this vast surprise."

    Surprise was the keynote. Something supremely astonishing! And now came this boy, this
    grinning youngster, glibly joyful about Tazenda and its undistinguished subnormality. And he
    had to be right. Fie had\o. Otherwise, nothing made sense.

    Pritcher's last conscious thought had a touch of grimness. That hypertracer along the Etheric
    tube was still there. Fie had checked it one hour back, with Channis well out of the way.

    SECOND INTERLUDE

    It was a casual meeting in the anteroom of the Council Chamber - just a few moments before



    passing into the Chamber to take up the business of the day - and the few thoughts flashed
    back and forth quickly.

    "So the Mule is on his way."

    "That's what I hear, too. Risky! Mighty risky!"

    "Not if affairs adhere to the functions set up."

    "The Mule is not an ordinary man - and it is difficult to manipulate his chosen instruments
    without detection by him. The controlled minds are difficult to touch. They say he's caught on to
    a few cases."

    "Yes, I don't see how that can be avoided."

    "Uncontrolled minds are easier. But so few are in positions of authority under him-"

    They entered the Chamber. Others of the Second Foundation followed them.

    Two Men and a Peasant

    Rossem is one of those marginal worlds usually neglected in Galactic history and scarcely ever
    obtruding itself upon the notice of men of the myriad happier planets.

    In the latter days of the Galactic Empire, a few political prisoners had inhabited its wastes, while
    an observatory and a small Naval garrison served to keep it from complete desertion. Later, in
    the evil days of strife, even before the time of Hari Seldon, the weaker sort of men, tired of the
    periodic decades of insecurity and danger; weary of sacked planets and a ghostly succession
    of ephemeral emperors making their way to the Purple for a few wicked, fruitless years - these
    men fled the populated centers and sought shelter in the barren nooks of the Galaxy.

    Along the chilly wastes of Rossem, villages huddled. Its sun was a small ruddy niggard that
    clutched its dribble of heat to itself, while snow beat thinly down for nine months of the year.

    The tough native grain lay dormant in the soil those snow-filled months, then grew and ripened
    in almost panic speed, when the sun's reluctant radiation brought the temperature to nearly
    fifty.

    Small, goatlike animals cropped the grasslands, kicking the thin snow aside with tiny, tri-hooved
    feet.

    The men of Rossem had, thus, their bread and their milk - and when they could spare an
    animal - even their meat. The darkly ominous forests that gnarled their way over half of the
    equatorial region of the planet supplied a tough, fine-grained wood for housing. This wood,
    together with certain furs and minerals, was even worth exporting, and the ships of the Empire
    came at times and brought in exchange farm machinery, atomic heaters, even televisor sets.
    The last was not really incongruous, for the long winter imposed a lonely hibernation upon the
    peasant.



    Imperial history flowed past the peasants of Rossem. The trading ships might bring news in
    impatient spurts; occasionally new fugitives would arrive - at one time, a relatively large group
    arrived in a body and remained - and these usually had news of the Galaxy.

    It was then that the Rossemites learned of sweeping battles and decimated populations or of
    tyrannical emperors and rebellious viceroys. And they would sigh and shake their heads, and
    draw their fur collars closer about their bearded faces as they sat about the village square in
    the weak sun and philosophized on the evil of men.

    Then after a while, no trading ships arrived at all, and life grew harder. Supplies of foreign, soft
    food, of tobacco, of machinery stopped. Vague word from scraps gathered on the televisor
    brought increasingly disturbing news. And finally it spread that Trantor had been sacked. The
    great capital world of all the Galaxy, the splendid, storied, unapproachable and incomparable
    home of the emperors had been despoiled and ruined and brought to utter destruction.

    It was something inconceivable, and to many of the peasants of Rossem, scratching away at
    their fields, it might well seem that the end of the Galaxy was at hand.

    And then one day not unlike other days a ship arrived again. The old men of each village
    nodded wisely and lifted their old eyelids to whisper that thus it had been in their father's time -
    but it wasn't, quite.

    This ship was not an Imperial ship. The glowing Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire was missing
    from its prow. It was a stubby affair made of scraps of older ships - and the men within called
    themselves soldiers of Tazenda.

    The peasants were confused. They had not heard of Tazenda, but they greeted the soldiers
    nevertheless in the traditional fashion of hospitality. The newcomers inquired closely as to the
    nature of the planet, the number of its inhabitants, the number of its cities - a word mistaken by
    the peasants to mean "villages" to the confusion of all concerned - its type of economy and so
    on.

    Other ships came and proclamations were issued all over the world that Tazenda was now the
    ruling world, that tax-collecting stations would be established girdling the equator - the
    inhabited region - that percentages of grain and furs according to certain numerical formulae
    would be collected annually.

    The Rossemites had blinked solemnly, uncertain of the word "taxes." When collection time
    came, many had paid, or had stood by in confusion while the uniformed, other-wordlings loaded
    the harvested corn and the pelts on to the broad ground-cars.

    Here and there indignant peasants banded together and brought out ancient hunting weapons
    - but of this nothing ever came. Grumblingly they had disbanded when the men of Tazenda
    came and with dismay watched their hard struggle for existence become harder.

    But a new equilibrium was reached. The Tazendian governor lived dourly in the village of
    Gentri, from which all Rossemites were barred. He and the officials under him were dim
    otherworld beings that rarely impinged on the Rossemite ken. The tax-farmers, Rossemites in
    the employ of Tazenda, came periodically, but they were creatures of custom now - and the



    peasant had learned how to hide his grain and drive his cattle into the forest, and refrain from
    having his hut appear too ostentatiously prosperous. Then with a dull, uncomprehending
    expression he would greet all sharp questioning as to his assets by merely pointing at what
    they could see.

    Even that grew less, and taxes decreased, almost as If Tazenda wearied of extorting pennies
    from such a world.

    Trading sprang up and perhaps Tazenda found that more profitable. The men of Rossem no
    longer received in exchange the polished creations of the Empire, but even Tazendian
    machines and Tazendian food was better than the native stuff. And there were clothes for the
    women of other than gray home-spun, which was a very important thing.

    So once again, Galactic history glided past peacefully enough, and the peasants scrabbled life
    out of the hard soil.

    Narovi blew into his beard as he stepped out of his cottage.

    The first snows were sifting across the hard ground and the sky was a dull, overcast pink. He
    squinted carefully upward and decided that no real storm was in sight. He could travel to Gentri
    without much trouble and get rid of his surplus grain in return for enough canned foods to last
    the winter.

    He roared back through the door, which he opened a crack for the purpose: "Has the car been
    fed its fuel, yunker?"

    A voice shouted from within, and then Narovi's oldest son, his short, red beard not yet
    completely outgrown its boyish sparseness, joined him.

    "The car," he said, sullenly, "is fueled and rides well, but for the bad condition of the axles. For
    that I am of no blame. I have told you it needs expert repairs."

    The old man stepped back and surveyed his son through lowering eyebrows, then thrust his
    hairy chin outward: "And is the fault mine? Where and in what manner may I achieve expert
    repairs? Has the harvest then been anything but scanty for five years? Have my herds escaped
    the pest? Have the pelts climbed of themselves-"

    "Narovi!" The well-known voice from within stopped him in mid-word. He grumbled, "Well, well -
    and now your mother must insert herself into the affairs of a father and his son. Bring out the
    car, and see to it that the storage trailers are securely attached."

    He pounded his gloved hands together, and looked upward again. The dimly-ruddy clouds were
    gathering and the gray sky that showed in the rifts bore no warmth. The sun was hidden.

    He was at the point of looking away, when his dropping eyes caught and his finger almost
    automatically rose on high while his mouth fell open in a shout, in complete disregard of the
    cold air.

    "Wife," he called vigorously, "Old woman - come here."

    An indignant head appeared at a window. The woman's eyes followed his finger, gaped. With a



    cry, she dashed down the wooden stairs, snatching up an old wrap and a square of linen as
    she went. She emerged with the linen wrapped insecurely over her head and ears, and the
    wrap dangling from her shoulders.

    She snuffled: "It is a ship from outer space."

    And Narovi remarked impatiently: "And what else could it be? We have visitors, old woman,
    visitors!"

    The ship was sinking slowly to a landing on the bare frozen field in the northern portions of
    Narovi's farm.

    "But what shall we do?" gasped the woman. "Can we offer these people hospitality? Is the dirt
    floor of our hovel to be theirs and the pickings of last week's hoecake?"

    "Shall they then go to our neighbors?" Narovi purpled past the crimson induced by the cold and
    his arms in their sleek fur covering lunged out and seized the woman's brawny shoulders.

    "Wife of my soul," he purred, "you will take the two chairs from our room downstairs; you will
    see that a fat youngling is slaughtered and roasted with tubers; you will bake a fresh hoecake. I
    go now to greet these men of power from outer space ... and ... and-" He paused, placed his
    great cap awry, and scratched hesitantly. "Yes, I shall bring my jug of brewed grain as well.
    Hearty drink is pleasant."

    The woman's mouth had flapped idly during this speech. Nothing came out. And when that
    stage passed, it was only a discordant screech that issued.

    Narovi lifted a finger, "Old woman, what was it the village Elders said a se'nnight since? Eh?

    Stir your memory. The Elders went from farm to farm - themselves! Imagine the importance of
    it! - to ask us that should any ships from outer space land, they were to be informed
    immediately on the orders of the governor.

    "And now shall I not seize the opportunity to win into the good graces of those in power?

    Regard that ship. Have you ever seen its like? These men from the outer worlds are rich, great.
    The governor himself sends such urgent messages concerning them that the Elders walk from
    farm to farm in the cooling weather. Perhaps the message is sent throughout all Rossem that
    these men are greatly desired by the Lords of Tazenda - and it is on my farm that they are
    landing."

    He fairly hopped for anxiety, "The proper hospitality now - the mention of my name to the
    governor - and what may not be ours?"

    His wife was suddenly aware of the cold biting through her thin house-clothing. She leaped
    towards the door, shouting over her shoulders, "Leave then quickly."

    But she was speaking to a man who was even then racing towards the segment of the horizon
    against which the ship sank.

    Neither the cold of the world, nor its bleak, empty spaces worried General Han Pritcher. Nor the
    poverty of their surroundings, nor the perspiring peasant himself.



    What did bother him was the question of the wisdom of their tactics? He and Channis were
    alone here.


    The ship, left in space, could take care of itself in ordinary circumstances, but still, he felt
    unsafe. It was Channis, of course, who was responsible for this move. He looked across at the
    young man and caught him winking cheerfully at the gap in the furred partition, in which a
    woman's peeping eyes and gaping mouth momentarily appeared.

    Channis, at least, seemed completely at ease. That fact Pritcher savored with a vinegary
    satisfaction. His game had not much longer to proceed exactly as he wished it. Yet, meanwhile
    their wrist ultrawave sender-receivers were their only connection with the ship.

    And then the peasant host smiled enormously and bobbed his head several times and said in a
    voice oily with respect, "Noble Lords, I crave leave to tell you that my eldest son - a good,
    worthy lad whom my poverty prevents from educating as his wisdom deserves - has informed
    me that the Elders will arrive soon. I trust your stay here has been as pleasant as my humble
    means - for I am poverty-stricken, though a hard-working, honest, and humble farmer, as
    anyone here will tell you - could afford."

    "Elders?" said Channis, lightly. "The chief men of the region here?"

    "So they are, Noble Lords, and honest, worthy men all of them, for our entire village is known
    throughout Rossem as a just and righteous spot - though living is hard and the returns of the
    fields and forests meager. Perhaps you will mention to the Elders, Noble Lords, of my respect
    and honor for travelers and it may happen that they will request a new motor wagon for our
    household as the old one can scarcely creep and upon the remnant of it depends our
    livelihood."

    He looked humbly eager and Han Pritcher nodded with thee properly aloof condescension
    required of the role of "Noble, Lords" bestowed upon them.

    "A report of your hospitality shall reach the ears of your Elders."

    Pritcher seized the next moments of isolation to speak to the apparently half-sleeping Channis.

    "I am not particularly fond of this meeting of the Elders," he said. "Have you any thoughts on
    the subject?"

    Channis seemed surprised. "No. What worries you?"

    "It seems we have better things to do than to become conspicuous here.'

    Channis spoke hastily, in a low monotoned voice: "It may be necessary to risk becoming
    conspicuous in our next moves. We won't find the type of men we want, Pritcher, by simply
    reaching out a hand into a dark bag and groping. Men who rule by tricks of the mind need not
    necessarily be men in obvious power. In the first place, the psychologists of the Second
    Foundation are probably a very small minority of the total population, just as on your own First
    Foundation, the technicians and scientists formed a minority. The ordinary inhabitants are
    probably just that - very ordinary. The psychologists may even be well hidden, and the men in
    the apparently ruling position, may honestly think they are the true masters. Our solution to that



    problem may be found here on this frozen lump of a planet."

    "I don't follow that at all."

    "Why, see here, it's obvious enough. Tazenda is probably a huge world of millions or hundreds
    of millions. How could we identify the psychologists among them and be able to report truly to
    the Mule that we have located the Second Foundation? But here, on this tiny peasant world
    and subject planet, an the Tazendian rulers, our host informs us, are concentrated in their chief
    village of Gentri. There may be only a few hundred of them there, Pritcher, and among them
    must be one or more of the men of the Second Foundation. We will go there eventually, but let
    us see the Elders first - it's a logical step on the way."

    They drew apart easily, as their black-bearded host tumbled into the room again, obviously
    agitated.

    "Noble Lords, the Elders are arriving. I crave leave to beg you once more to mention a word,
    perhaps, on my behalf-" He almost bent double in a paroxysm of fawning.

    "We shall certainly remember you," said Channis. "Are these your Elders?"

    They apparently were. There were three.

    One approached. He bowed with a dignified respect and said: "We are honored. Transportation
    has been provided, Respected sirs, and we hope for the pleasure of your company at our
    Meeting Hall."


    THIRD INTERLUDE

    The First Speaker gazed wistfully at the night sky. Wispy clouds scudded across the faint
    stargleams. Space looked actively hostile. It was cold and awful at best but now it contained
    that strange creature, the Mule, and the very content seemed to darken and thicken it into
    ominous threat.

    The meeting was over. It had not been long. There had been the doubts and questionings
    inspired by the difficult mathematical problem of dealing with a mental mutant of uncertain
    makeup. All the extreme permutations had had to be considered.

    Were they even yet certain? Somewhere in this region of space - within reaching distance as
    Galactic spaces go - was the Mule. What would he do?

    It was easy enough to handle his men. They reacted - and were reacting - according to plan.
    But what of the Mule himself?


    4



    Two Men and the Elders

    The Elders of this particular region of Rossem were not exactly what one might have expected.
    They were not a mere extrapolation of the peasantry; older, more authoritative, less friendly.

    Not at all.

    The dignity that had marked them at first meeting had grown in impression till it had reached
    the mark of being their predominant characteristic.

    They sat about their oval table like so many grave and slow-moving thinkers. Most were a trifle
    past their physical prime, though the few who possessed beards wore them short and neatly
    arranged. Still, enough appeared younger than forty to make it quite obvious that "Elders" was
    a term of respect rather than entirely a literal description of age.

    The two from outer space were at the head of the table and in the solemn silence that
    accompanied a rather frugal meal that seemed ceremonious rather than nourishing, absorbed
    the new, contrasting atmosphere.

    After the meal and after one or two respectful remarks - too short and simple to be called
    speeches - had been made by those of the Elders apparently held most in esteem, an
    informality forced itself upon the assembly.

    It was as if the dignity of greeting foreign personages had finally given way to the amiable rustic
    qualities of curiosity and friendliness.

    They crowded around the two strangers and the flood of questions came.

    They asked if it were difficult to handle a spaceship, how many men were required for the job, if
    better motors could be made for their ground-cars, if it was true that it rarely snowed on other
    worlds as was said to be the case with Tazenda, how many people lived on their world, if it was
    as large as Tazenda, if it was far away, how their clothes were woven and what gave them the
    metallic shimmer, why they did not wear furs, if they shaved every day, what sort of stone that
    was in Pritcher's ring - The list stretched out.

    And almost always the questions were addressed to Pritcher as though, as the elder, they
    automatically invested him with the greater authority. Pritcher found himself forced to answer at
    greater and greater length. It was like an immersion in a crowd of children. Their questions
    were those of utter and disarming wonder. Their eagerness to know was completely irresistible
    and would not be denied.

    Pritcher explained that spaceships were not difficult to handle and that crews varied with the
    size, from one to many, that the motors of their ground-cars were unknown in detail to him but
    could doubtless be improved, that the climates of worlds varied almost infinitely, that many
    hundreds of millions lived on his world but that it was far smaller and more insignificant than the
    great empire of Tazenda, that their clothes were woven of silicone plastics in which metallic
    luster was artificially produced by proper orientation of the surface molecules, and that they
    could be artificially heated so that furs were unnecessary, that they shaved every day, that the
    stone in his ring was an amethyst. The list stretched out. He found himself thawing to these



    naive provincials against his will.

    And always as he answered there was a rapid chatter among the Elders, as though they
    debated the information gained. It was difficult to follow these inner discussions of theirs for
    they lapsed into their own accented version of the universal Galactic language that, through
    long separation from the currents of living speech, had become archaic.

    Almost, one might say, their curt comments among themselves hovered on the edge of
    understanding, but just managed to elude the clutching tendrils of comprehension.

    Until finally Channis interrupted to say, "Good sirs, you must answer us for a while, for we are
    strangers and would be very much interested to know all we can of Tazenda."

    And what happened then was that a great silence fell and each of the hitherto voluble Elders
    grew silent. Their hands, which had been moving in such rapid and delicate accompaniment to
    their words as though to give them greater scope and varied shades of meaning, fell suddenly
    limp. They stared furtively at one another, apparently quite willing each to let the other have all
    the floor.

    Pritcher interposed quickly, "My companion asks this in friendliness, for the fame of Tazenda
    fills the Galaxy and we, of course, shall inform the governor of the loyalty and love of the Elders
    of Rossem."

    No sigh of relief was heard but faces brightened. An Elder stroked his beard with thumb and
    forefinger, straightening its slight curl with a gentle pressure, and said: "We are faithful servants
    of the Lords of Tazenda."

    Pritcher's annoyance at Channis' bald question subsided. It was apparent, at least, that the age
    that he had felt creeping over him of late had not yet deprived him of his own capacity for
    making smooth the blunders of others.

    He continued: "We do not know, in our far part of the universe, much of the past history of the
    Lords of Tazenda. We presume they have ruled benevolently here for a long time."

    The same Elder who spoke before, answered. In a soft, automatic way he had become
    spokesman. He said: "Not the grandfather of the oldest can recall a time in which the Lords
    were absent."

    "It has been a time of peace?"

    "It has been a time of peace!" He hesitated. "The governor is a strong and powerful Lord who
    would not hesitate to punish traitors. None of us are traitors, of course."

    "He has punished some in the past, I imagine, as they deserve."

    Again hesitation, "None here have ever been traitors, or our fathers or our fathers' fathers. But
    on other worlds, there have been such, and death followed for them quickly. It is not good to
    think of for we are humble men who are poor farmers and not concerned with matters of
    politics."

    The anxiety in his voice, the universal concern in the eyes of all of them was obvious.



    Pritcher said smoothly: "Could you inform us as to how we can arrange an audience with your
    governor."

    And instantly an element of sudden bewilderment entered the situation.

    For after a long moment, the elder said: "Why, did you not know? The governor will be here
    tomorrow. He has expected you. It has been a great honor for us. We ... we hope earnestly that
    you will report to him satisfactorily as to our loyalty to him."

    Pritcher's smile scarcely twitched. "Expected us?"

    The Elder looked wonderingly from one to the other. "Why ... it is now a week since we have
    been waiting for you."

    Their quarters were undoubtedly luxurious for the world. Pritcher had lived in worse. Channis
    showed nothing but indifference to externals.

    But there was an element of tension between them of a different nature than hitherto. Pritcher,
    felt the time approaching for a definite decision and yet there was still the desirability of
    additional waiting. To see the governor first would be to increase the gamble to dangerous
    dimensions and yet to win that gamble might multi-double the winnings. He felt a surge of
    anger at the slight crease between Channis' eyebrows, the delicate uncertainty with which the
    young man's lower lip presented itself to an upper tooth. He detested the useless play-acting
    and yearned for an end to it.

    He said: "We seem to be anticipated."

    'Yes," said Channis, simply.

    "Just that? You have no contribution of greater pith to make. We come here and find that the
    governor expects us. Presumably we shall find from the governor that Tazenda itself expects
    us. Of what value then is our entire mission?"

    Channis looked up, without endeavoring to conceal the weary note in his voice: "To expect us
    is one thing; to know who we are and what we came for, is another."

    "Do you expect to conceal these things from men of the Second Foundation?"

    "Perhaps. Why not? Are you ready to throw your hand in? Suppose our ship was detected in
    space. Is it unusual for a realm to maintain frontier observation posts? Even if we were ordinary
    strangers, we would be of interest."

    "Sufficient interest for a governor to come to us rather than the reverse?'

    Channis shrugged: "We’ll have to meet that problem later. Let us see what this governor is
    like."

    Pritcher bared his teeth in a bloodless kind of scowl. The situation was becoming ridiculous.

    Channis proceeded with an artificial animation: "At least we know one thing. Tazenda is the
    Second Foundation or a million shreds of evidence are unanimously pointing the wrong way.



    How do you interpret the obvious terror in which these natives hold Tazenda? I see no signs of
    political domination. Their groups of Elders apparently meet freely and without interference of
    any sort. The taxation they speak of doesn't seem at all extensive to me or efficiently carried
    through. The natives speak much of poverty but seem sturdy and well-fed. The houses are
    uncouth and their villages rude, but are obviously adequate for the purpose.

    "In fact, the world fascinates me. I have never seen a more forbidding one, yet I am convinced
    there is no suffering among the population and that their uncomplicated lives manage to
    contain a well-balanced happiness lacking in the sophisticated populations of the advanced
    centers."

    "Are you an admirer of peasant virtues, then?"

    "The stars forbid." Channis seemed amused at the idea. "I merely point out the significance of
    all this. Apparently, Tazenda is an efficient administrator - efficient in a sense far different from
    the efficiency of the old Empire or of the First Foundation, or even of our own Union. All these
    have brought mechanical efficiency to their subjects at the cost of more intangible values.
    Tazenda brings happiness and sufficiency. Don't you see that the whole orientation of their
    domination is different? It is not physical, but psychological."

    "Really?" Pritcher, allowed himself irony. "And the terror with which the Elders spoke of the
    punishment of treason by these kind hearted psychologist administrators? How does that suit
    your thesis?"

    "Were they the objects of the punishment? They speak of punishment only of others. It is as if
    knowledge of punishment has been so well implanted in them that punishment itself need never
    be used. The proper mental attitudes are so inserted into their minds that I am certain that not a
    Tazendian soldier exists on the planet. Don't you see all this?"

    "I’ll see perhaps," said Pritcher, coldly, "when I see the governor. And what, by the way, if our
    mentalities are handled?"

    Channis replied with brutal contempt: "You should be accustomed to that."

    Pritcher whitened perceptibly, and, with an effort, turned away. They spoke to one another no
    more that day.

    It was in the silent windlessness of the frigid night, as he listened to the soft, sleeping motions
    of the other, that Pritcher silently adjusted his wrist-transmitter to the ultrawave region for which
    Channis' was unadjustable and, with noiseless touches of his fingernail, contacted the ship.

    The answer came in little periods of noiseless vibration that barely lifted themselves above the
    sensory threshold.

    Twice Pritcher asked: "Any communications at all yet?"

    Twice the answer came: "None. We wait always."

    He got out of bed. It was cold in the room and he pulled the furry blanket around him as he sat
    in the chair and stared out at the crowding stars so different in the brightness and complexity of



    their arrangement from the even fog of the Galactic Lens that dominated the night sky of his
    native Periphery.

    Somewhere there between the stars was the answer to the complications that overwhelmed
    him, and he felt the yearning for that solution to arrive and end things.

    For a moment he wondered again if the Mule were right - if Conversion had robbed him of the
    firm sharp edge of self-reliance. Or was it simply age and the fluctuations of these last years?

    He didn't really care.

    He was tired.

    The governor of Rossem arrived with minor ostentation. His only companion was the uniformed
    man at the controls of the ground-car.

    The ground-car itself was of lush design but to Pritcher it appeared inefficient. It turned
    clumsily; more than once it apparently balked at what might have been a too-rapid change of
    gears. It was obvious at once from its design that it ran on chemical, and not on atomic, fuel.

    The Tazendian governor stepped softly on to the thin layer of snow and advanced between two
    lines of respectful Elders. He did not look at them but entered quickly. They followed after him.

    From the quarters assigned to them, the two men of the Mule's Union watched. He - the
    governor -was thickset, rather stocky, short, unimpressive.

    But what of that?

    Pritcher cursed himself for a failure of nerve. His face, to be sure, remained icily calm. There
    was no humiliation before Channis - but he knew very well that his blood pressure had
    heightened and his throat had become dry.

    It was not a case of physical fear. He was not one of those dull-witted, unimaginative men of
    nerveless meat who were too stupid ever to be afraid - but physical fear he could account for
    and discount.

    But this was different. It was the other fear.

    He glanced quickly at Channis. The young man glanced idly at the nails of one hand and poked
    leisurely at some trifling unevenness.

    Something inside Pritcher became vastly indignant. What had Channis to fear of mental
    handling?

    Pritcher caught a mental breath and tried to think back. How had he been before the Mule had
    Converted him from the die-hard Democrat that he was. It was hard to remember. He could not
    place himself mentally. He could not break the clinging wires that bound him emotionally to the
    Mule. Intellectually, he could remember that he had once tried to assassinate the Mule but not
    for all the straining he could endure, could he remember his emotions at the time. That might
    be the self-defense of his own mind, however, for at the intuitive thought of what those
    emotions might have been - not realizing the details, but merely comprehending the drift of it -



    his stomach grew queasy.

    What if the governor tampered with his mind?

    What if the insubstantial mental tendrils of a Second Foundationer insinuated itself down the
    emotional crevices of his makeup and pulled them apart and rejoined them?

    There had been no sensation the first time. There had been no pain, no mental jar - not even a
    feeling of discontinuity. He had always loved the Mule. If there had ever been a time long
    before - as long before as five short years - when he had thought he hadn't loved him, that he
    had hated him - that was just a horrid illusion. The thought of that illusion embarrassed him.

    But there had been no pain.

    Would meeting the governor duplicate that? Would all that had gone before - all his service for
    the Mule - all his life's orientation - join the hazy, other-life dream that held the word,
    Democracy. The Mule also a dream, and only to Tazenda, his loyalty—

    Sharply, he turned away.

    There was that strong desire to retch.

    And then Channis' voice clashed on his ear, "I think this is it, general."

    Pritcher turned again. An Elder had opened the door silently and stood with a dignified and
    calm respect upon the threshold.

    He said, "His Excellency, Governor of Rossem, in the name of the Lords of Tazenda, is pleased
    to present his permission for an audience and request your appearance before him."

    "Sure thing," and Channis tightened his belt with a jerk and adjusted a Rossemian hood over
    his head.

    Pritcher's jaw set. This was the beginning of the real gamble.

    The governor of Rossem was not of formidable appearance. For one thing, he was
    bareheaded, and his thinning hair, light brown, tending to gray, lent him mildness. His bony
    eye-ridges lowered at them, and his eyes, set in a fine network of surrounding wrinkles,
    seemed calculating, but his fresh-cropped chin was soft and small and, by the universal
    convention of followers of the pseudoscience of reading character by facial bony structure,
    seemed "weak."

    Pritcher, avoided the eyes and watched the chin. He didn't know whether that would be
    effective - if anything would be.

    The governor's voice was high-pitched, indifferent: "Welcome to Tazenda. We greet you in
    peace. You have eaten?"

    His hand - long fingers, gnarled veins - waved almost regally at the U-shaped table.

    They bowed and sat down. The governor sat at the outer side of the base of the U, they on the
    inner; along both arms sat the double row of silent Elders.



    The governor spoke in short, abrupt sentences - praising the food as Tazendian importations -
    and it had indeed a quality different if, somehow, not so much better, than the rougher food of
    the Elders - disparaging Rossemian weather, referring with an attempt at casualness to the
    intricacies of space travel.

    Channis talked little. Pritcher not at all.

    Then it was over. The small, stewed fruits were finished; the napkins used and discarded, and
    the governor leaned back.

    His small eyes sparkled.

    "I have inquired as to your ship. Naturally, I would like to see that it receives due care and
    overhaul. I am told its whereabouts are unknown."

    "True." Channis replied lightly. "We have left it in space. It is a large ship, suitable for long
    journeys in sometimes hostile regions, and we felt that landing it here might give rise to doubts
    as to our peaceful intentions. We preferred to land alone, unarmed."

    "A friendly act," commented the governor, without conviction. "A large ship, you say?"

    "Not a vessel of war, excellency."

    "Ha, hum. Where is it you come from?"

    "A small world of the Santanni sector, your excellency. It may be you are not aware of its
    existence for it lacks importance. We are interested in establishing trade relationships."

    "Trade, eh? And what have you to sell?'

    "Machines of all sorts, excellency. In return, food, wood, ores

    "Ha, hum." The governor seemed doubtful. "I know little these matters. Perhaps mutual profit
    may be arranged. Perhaps, after I have examined your credentials at length - for much
    information will be required by my government before matters may proceed, you understand -
    and after I have looked over your ship, it would be advisable for you to proceed to Tazenda."

    There was no answer to that, and the governor's attitude iced perceptibly.

    "It is necessary that I see your ship, however."

    Channis said distantly: "The ship, unfortunately, is undergoing repairs at the moment. If your
    excellency would not object giving us forty-eight hours, it will be at your service."

    "I am not accustomed to waiting."

    For the first time, Pritcher met the glare of the other, eye to eye, and his breath exploded softly
    inside him. For a moment, he had the sensation of drowning, but then his eyes tore away.

    Channis did not waver. He said: "The ship cannot be landed for forty-eight hours, excellency.
    We are here and unarmed. Can you doubt our honest intentions?"



    There was a long silence, and then the governor said gruffly, "Tell me of the world from which
    you come."

    That was all. It passed with that. There was no more unpleasantness. The governor, having
    fulfilled his official duty, apparently lost interest and the audience died a dull death.

    And when it was all over, Pritcher found himself back in their quarters and took stock of himself.

    Carefully - holding his breath - he "felt" his emotions. Certainly he seemed no different to
    himself, but would he feel any difference? Had he felt different after the Mule's Conversion?

    Had not everything seemed natural? As it should have been?

    He experimented.

    With cold purpose, he shouted inside the silent caverns of his mind, and the shout was, "The
    Second Foundation must be discovered and destroyed."

    And the emotion that accompanied it was honest hate. There was not as much as a hesitation
    involved in it.

    And then it was in his mind to substitute the word "Mule" for the phrase "Second Foundation"
    and his breath caught at the mere emotion and his tongue clogged.

    So far, good.

    But had he been handled otherwise - more subtly? Had tiny changes been made? Changes
    that he couldn't detect because their very existence warped his judgment.

    There was no way to tell.

    But he still felt absolute loyalty to the Mule! If that were unchanged, nothing else really
    mattered.

    He turned his mind to action again. Channis was busy at his end of the room. Pritcher's
    thumbnail idled at his wrist communicator.

    And then at the response that came he felt a wave of relief surge over him and leave him weak.

    The quiet muscles of his face did not betray him, but inside he was shouting with joy - and
    when Channis turned to face him, he knew that the farce was about over.

    FOURTH INTERLUDE

    The two Speakers passed each other on the road and one stopped the other.

    "I have word from the First Speaker."

    There was a half-apprehensive flicker in the other's eyes. "Intersection point?"

    "Yes! May we live to see the dawn!"



    5

    One Man and the Mule

    There was no sign in any of Channis' actions that he was aware of any subtle change in the
    attitude of Pritcher, and in their relations to each other. He leaned back on the hard wooden
    bench and spread-eagled his feet out in front of him.

    "What did you make of the governor?"

    Pritcher shrugged: "Nothing at all. He certainly seemed no mental genius to me. A very poor
    specimen of the Second Foundation, if that's what he was supposed to be."

    "I don't think he was, you know. I'm not sure what to make of it. Suppose you were a Second
    Foundationer," Channis grew thoughtful, "what would yoi/do? Suppose you had an idea of our
    purpose here. How would you handle us?"

    "Conversion, of course."

    "Like the Mule?" Channis looked up, sharply. "Would we know if they had converted us? I
    wonder- And what if they were simply psychologists, but very clever ones."

    "In that case, I'd have us killed rather quickly."

    "And our ship? No." Channis wagged a forefinger. "We're playing a bluff, Pritcher, old man. It
    can only be a bluff. Even if they have emotional control down pat, we - you and I - are only
    fronts. It's the Mule they must fight, and they're being just as careful of us as we are of them.

    I'm assuming that they know who we are."

    Pritcher, stared coldly: "What do you intend doing?"

    "Wait." The word was bitten off. "Let them come to us. They're worried, maybe about the ship,
    but probably about the Mule. They bluffed with the governor. It didn't work. We stayed pat. The
    next person they'll send will be a Second Foundationer, and he’ll propose a deal of some sort."

    "And then?"

    "And then we make the deal."

    "I don't think so."

    "Because you think it will double-cross the Mule? It won't."

    "No, the Mule could handle your double-crosses, any you could invent. But I still don't think so."
    "Because you think then we couldn't double-cross the Foundationers?"

    "Perhaps not. But that’s not the reason."

    Channis let his glance drop to what the other held in his fist, and said grimly: "You mean that's
    the reason."



    Pritcher cradled his blaster, "That's right. You are under arrest."

    "Why?"

    "For treason to the First Citizen of the Union."

    Channis' lips hardened upon one another: "What's going on?"

    "Treason! As I said. And correction of the matter, on my part."

    "Your proof? Or evidence, assumptions, daydreams? Are you mad?"

    "No. Are you? Do you think the Mule sends out unweaned youngsters on ridiculous
    swashbuckling missions for nothing? It was queer to me at the time. But I wasted time in
    doubting myself. Why should he send you? Because you smile and dress well? Because you're
    twenty-eight."

    "Perhaps because I can be trusted. Or aren't you in the market for logical reasons?"

    "Or perhaps because you can't be trusted. Which is logical enough, as it turns out."

    "Are we matching paradoxes, or is this all a word game to see who can say the least in the
    most words?"

    And the blaster advanced, with Pritcher after it. Fie stood erect before the younger man: "Stand
    up!"

    Channis did so, in no particular hurry, and felt the muzzle of the blaster touch his belt with no
    shrinking of the stomach muscles.

    Pritcher said: "What the Mule wanted was to find the Second Foundation. Fie had failed and I
    had failed, and the secret that neither of us can find is a well-hidden one. So there was one
    outstanding possibility left - and that was to find a seeker who ready knew the hiding-place."

    "Is that I?"

    "Apparently it was. I didn't know then, of course, but though my mind must be slowing, it still
    points in the right direction. Flow easily we found Star's End! Flow miraculously you examined
    the correct Field Region of the Lens from among an infinite number of possibles! And having
    done so, how nicely we observe just the correct point for observation! You clumsy fool! Did you
    so underestimate me that no combination of impossible fortuties struck you as being too much
    for me to swallow?"

    "You mean I've been too successful?"

    "Too successful by half for any loyal man."

    "Because the standards of success you set me were so low?"

    And the blaster prodded, though in the face that confront Channis only the cold glitter of the
    eyes betrayed the growing anger: "Because you are in the pay of the Second Foundation."



    "Pay?"- infinite contempt. "Prove that."

    "Or under the mental influence."

    "Without the Mule's knowledge? Ridiculous."

    "With the Mule's knowledge. Exactly my point, my you dullard. With the Mule's knowledge. Do
    you suppose else that you would be given a ship to play with? You led us to the Second
    Foundation as you were supposed to do."

    "I thresh a kernel of something or other out of this immensity of chaff. May I ask why I'm
    supposed to be doing all this? If were a traitor, why should I lead you to the Second
    Foundation? Why not hither and yon through the Galaxy, skipping gaily, finding no more than
    you ever did?'

    "For the sake of the ship. And because the men of the Second Foundation quite obviously need
    atomic warfare for self-defense."

    'You'll have to do better than that. One ship won't mean thing to them, and if they think they'll
    learn science from it a build atomic power plants next year, they are very, very simple Second
    Foundationers, indeed. On the order of simplicity as yourself, I should say."

    "You will have the opportunity to explain that to the Mule."

    "We're going back to Kalgan?"

    "On the contrary. We're staying here. And the Mule will join us in fifteen minutes - more or less.
    Do you think he hasn't followed us, my sharp-witted, nimble-minded lump of self-admiration?
    You have played the decoy well in reverse. You may not have led our victims to us, but you
    have certainly led us to our victims."

    "May I sit down," said Channis, "and explain something to you in picture drawings? Please."
    "You will remain standing."

    At that, I can say it as well standing. You think the Mule followed us because of the hypertracer
    on the communication circuit?"

    The blaster might have wavered. Channis wouldn't have sworn to it. Fie said: "You don't look
    surprised. But I don't waste time doubting that you feel surprised. Yes, I knew about it. And
    now, having shown you that I knew of something you didn't think I did, I'll tell you something
    you don't know, that I know you don't."

    "You allow yourself too many preliminaries, Channis. I should think your sense of invention was
    more smoothly greased.

    "There's on invention to this. There have been traitors, of course, or enemy agents, if you prefer
    that term. But the Mule knew of that in a rather curious way. It seems, you see, that some of his
    Converted men had been tampered with."

    The blaster did waver that time. Unmistakably.



    "I emphasize that, Pritcher. It was why he needed me. I was an Unconverted man. Didn't he
    emphasize to you that he needed an Unconverted? Whether he gave you the real reason or
    not?"

    "Try something else, Channis. If I were against the Mule, I'd know it." Quietly, rapidly, Pritcher
    was feeling his mind. It felt the same. It felt the same. Obviously the man was lying.

    "You mean you feel loyal to the Mule. Perhaps. Loyalty wasn't tampered with. Too easily
    detectable, the Mule said. But how do you feel mentally? Sluggish? Since you started this trip,
    have you always felt normal? Or have you felt strange sometimes, as though you weren't quite
    yourself? What are you trying to do, bore a hole through me without touching the trigger?"

    Pritcher withdrew his blaster half an inch, "What are you trying to say?"

    "I say that you've been tampered with. You've been handled. You didn't see the Mule install that
    hypertracer. You didn't see anyone do it. You just found it there, and assumed it was the Mule,
    and ever since you've been assuming he was following us. Sure, the wrist receiver you're
    wearing contacts the ship on a wave length mine isn't good for. Do you think I didn't know
    that?" He was speaking quickly now, angrily. His cloak of indifference had dissolved into
    savagery. "But it's not the Mule that's coming toward us from out there. It's not the Mule."

    "Who, if not?"

    "Well, who do you suppose? I found that hypertracer, the day we left. But I didn't think it was
    the Mule. He had no reason for indirection at that point. Don't you see the nonsense of it? If I
    were a traitor and he knew that, I could be Converted as easily as you were, and he would
    have the secret of the location of the Second Foundation out of my mind without sending me
    half across the Galaxy. Can you keep a secret from the Mule? And if / didn't know, then I
    couldn't lead him to it. So why send me in either case?

    "Obviously, that hypertracer must have been put there by an agent of the Second Foundation.
    That's who's coming towards us now. And would you have been fooled if your precious mind
    hadn't been tampered with? What kind of normality have you that you imagine immense folly to
    be wisdom? Me bring a ship to the Second Foundation? What would they do with a ship?

    "It's you they want, Pritcher. You know more about the Union than anyone but the Mule, and
    you're not dangerous to them while he is. That’s why they put the direction of search into my
    mind. Of course, it was completely impossible for me to find Tazenda by random searchings of
    the Lens. I knew that. But I knew there was the Second Foundation after us, and I knew they
    engineered it. Why not play their game? It was a battle of bluffs. They wanted us and I wanted
    their location - and space take the one that couldn't outbluff the other.

    "But it's we that will lose as long as you hold that blaster on me. And it obviously isn't your idea.
    It's theirs. Give me the blaster, Pritcher. I know it seems wrong to you, but it isn't your mind
    speaking, it's the Second Foundation within you. Give me the blaster, Pritcher, and we’ll face
    what's coming now, together."

    Pritcher, faced a growing confusion in horror. Plausibility! Could he be so wrong? Why this
    eternal doubt of himself? Why wasn't he sure? What made Channis sound so plausible?



    Plausibility!

    Or was it his own tortured mind fighting the invasion of the alien.

    Was he split in two?

    Hazily, he saw Channis standing before him, hand outstretched - and suddenly, he knew he
    was going to give him the blaster.

    And as the muscles of his arm were on the point of contracting in the proper manner to do so,
    the door opened, not hastily, behind him - and he turned.

    There are perhaps men in the Galaxy who can be confused for one another even by men at
    their peaceful leisure. Correspondingly, there may be conditions of mind when even unlikely
    pairs may be mis-recognized. But the Mule rises above any combination of the two factors.

    Not all Pritcher's agony of mind prevented the instantaneous mental flood of cool vigor that
    engulfed him.

    Physically, the Mule could not dominate any situation. Nor did he dominate this one.

    He was rather a ridiculous figure in his layers of clothing that thickened him past his normality
    without allowing him to reach normal dimensions even so. His face was muffled and the usually
    dominant beak covered what was left in a cold-red prominence.

    Probably as a vision of rescue, no greater incongruity could exist.

    He said: "Keep your blaster, Pritcher."

    Then he turned to Channis, who had shrugged and seated himself: "The emotional context
    here seems rather confusing and considerably in conflict. What's this about someone other
    than myself following you?"

    Pritcher intervened sharply: "Was a hypertracer placed upon our ship by your orders, sir?"

    The Mule turned cool eyes upon him, "Certainly. Is it very likely that any organization in the
    Galaxy other than the Union of Worlds would have access to it?'

    "He said-"

    "Well, he's here, general. Indirect quotation is not necessary. Have you been saying anything,
    Channis?"

    "Yes. But mistakes apparently, sir. It has been my opinion that the tracer was put there by
    someone in the pay of the Second Foundation and that we had been led here for some
    purpose of theirs, which I was prepared to counter. I was under the further impression that the
    general was more or less in their hands."

    "You sound as if you think so no longer."

    "I'm afraid not. Or it would not have been you at the door."

    "Well, then, let us thresh this out." The Mule peeled off the outer layers of padded, and



    electrically heated clothing. "Do you mind if I sit down as well? Now - we are safe here and
    perfectly free of any danger of intrusion. No native of this lump of ice will have any desire to
    approach this place. I assure you of that," and there was a grim earnestness about his
    insistence upon his powers.

    Channis showed his disgust. "Why privacy? Is someone going to serve tea and bring out the
    dancing girls?"

    "Scarcely. What was this theory of yours, young man? A Second Foundationer was tracing you
    with a device which no one but I have and - how did you say you found this place?"

    "Apparently, sir, it seems obvious, in order to account for known facts, that certain notions have
    been put into my head-"

    "By these same Second Foundationers?"

    "No one else, I imagine."

    "Then it did not occur to you that if a Second Foundationer could force, or entice, or inveigle
    you into going to the Second Foundation for purposes of his own - and I assume you imagined
    he used methods similar to mine, though, mind you, I can implant only emotions, not ideas - it
    did not occur to you that if he could do that there was little necessity to put a hypertracer on
    you.

    And Channis looked up sharply and met his sovereign's large eyes with sudden startle. Pritcher
    grunted and a visible relaxation showed itself in his shoulders.

    "No," said Channis, "that hadn't occurred to me."

    "Or that if they were obliged to trace you, they couldn't feel capable of directing you, and that,
    undirected, you could have precious little chance of finding your way here as you did. Did that
    occur to you?"

    "That, neither."

    "Why not? Flas your intellectual level receded to a so-much-greater-than-probable degree?"

    "The only answer is a question, sir. Are you joining General Pritcher in accusing me of being a
    traitor?"

    "You have a defense in case I am?"

    "Only the one I presented to the general. If I were a traitor and knew the whereabouts of the
    Second Foundation, you could Convert me and learn the knowledge directly. If you felt it
    necessary to trace me, then I hadn't the knowledge beforehand and wasn't a traitor. So I
    answer your paradox with another."

    "Then your conclusion?"

    "That I am not a traitor."

    "To which I must agree, since your argument is irrefutable."



    "Then may I ask you why you had us secretly followed?"

    "Because to all the facts there is a third explanation. Both you and Pritcher explained some
    facts in your own individual ways, but not all. I - if you can spare me the time - will explain all.
    And in a rather short time, so there is little danger of boredom. Sit down, Pritcher, and give me
    your blaster. There is no danger of attack on us any longer. None from in here and none from
    out there. None in fact even from the Second Foundation. Thanks to you, Channis."

    The room was lit in the usual Rossemian fashion of electrically heated wire. A single bulb was
    suspended from the ceiling and in its dim yellow glow, the three cast their individual shadows.

    The Mule said: "Since I felt it necessary to trace Channis, it was obvious I expect to gain
    something thereby. Since he went to the Second Foundation with a startling speed and
    directness, we can reasonably assume that that was what I was expecting to happen. Since I
    did not gain the knowledge from him directly, something must have been preventing me. Those
    are the facts. Channis, of course, knows the answer. So do I. Do you see it, Pritcher?"

    And Pritcher said doggedly: "No, sir."

    "Then I’ll explain. Only one kind of man can both know the location of the Second Foundation
    and prevent me from learning it. Channis, I'm afraid you're a Second Foundationer yourself."

    And Channis' elbows rested on his knees as he leaned forward, and through stiff and angry lips
    said: "What is your direct evidence? Deduction has proven wrong twice today."

    "There is direct evidence, too, Channis. It was easy enough. I told you that my men had been
    tampered with. The tamperer must have been, obviously, someone who was a) Unconverted,
    and b) fairly close to the center of things. The field was large but not entirely unlimited. You
    were too successful, Channis. People liked you too much. You got along too well. I wondered-

    "And then I summoned you to take over this expedition and it didn't set you back. I watched
    your emotions. It didn't bother you. You overplayed the confidence there, Channis. No man of
    real competence could have avoided a dash of uncertainty at a job like that. Since your mind
    did avoid it, it was either a foolish one or a controlled one.

    It was easy to test the alternatives. I seized your mind at a moment of relaxation and filled it
    with grief for an instant and then removed it. You were angry afterwards with such
    accomplished art that I could have sworn it was a natural reaction, but for that which went first.
    For when I wrenched at your emotions, for just one instant, for one tiny instant before you could
    catch yourself, your mind resisted. It was all I needed to know.

    "No one could have resisted me, even for that tiny instant, without control similar to mine."
    Channis' voice was low and bitter: "Well, then? Now what?"

    "And now you die - as a Second Foundationer. Quite necessary, as I believe you realize."

    And once again Channis stared into the muzzle of a blaster. A muzzle guided this time by a
    mind, not like Pritcher's capable of offhand twisting to suit himself, but by one as mature as his
    own and as resistant to force as his own.



    And the period of time allotted him for a correction of events was small.

    What followed thereafter is difficult to describe by one with the normal complement of senses
    and the normal incapacity for emotional control.

    Essentially, this is what Channis realized in the tiny space of time involved in the pushing of the
    Mule's thumb upon the trigger contact.

    The Mule's current emotional makeup was one of a hard and polished determination, unmisted
    by hesitation in the least. Had Channis been sufficiently interested afterward to calculate the
    time involved from the determination to shoot to the arrival of the disintegrating energies, he
    might have realized that his leeway was about one-fifth of a second.

    That was barely time.

    What the Mule realized in that same tiny space of time was that the emotional potential of
    Channis' brain had surged suddenly upwards without his own mind feeling any impact and that,
    simultaneously, a flood of pure, thrilling hatred cascaded upon him from an unexpected
    direction.

    It was that new emotional element that jerked his thumb off the contact. Nothing else could
    have done it, and almost together with his change of action, came complete realization of the
    new situation.

    It was a tableau that endured far less than the significance adhering to it should require from a
    dramatic standpoint. There was the Mule, thumb off the blaster, staring intently upon Channis
    There was Channis taut, not quite daring to breathe yet. And there was Pritcher, convulsed in
    his chair; every muscle at a spasmodic breaking point; every tendon writhing in an effort to hurl
    forward; his face twisted at last out of schooled woodenness into an unrecognizable death
    mask of horrid hate; and his eyes only and entirely and supremely upon the Mule.

    Only a word or two passed between Channis and the Mule - only a word or two and that utterly
    revealing stream of emotional consciousness that remains forever the true interplay of
    understanding between such as they. For the sake of our own limits, it is necessary to translate
    into words what went on, then, and thenceforward.

    Channis said, tensely: "You’re between two fires, First Citizen. You can't control two minds
    simultaneously, not when one of them is mine - so you have your choice. Pritcher, is free of
    your Conversion now. I've snapped the bonds. He's the old Pritcher; the one who tried to kill
    you once; the one who thinks you're the enemy of all that is free and right and holy; and he's
    the one besides who knows that you've debased him to helpless adulation for five years. I'm
    holding him back now by suppressing his will, but if you kill me, that ends, and in considerably
    less time than you could shift your blaster or even your will - he will kill you."

    The Mule quite plainly realized that. He did not move.

    Channis continued: "If you turn to place him under control, to kill him, to do anything, you won't
    ever be quick enough to turn again to stop me."

    The Mule still did not move. Only a soft sigh of realization.



    "So," said Channis, "throw down the blaster, and let us be on even terms again, and you can
    have Pritcher back."


    "I made a mistake," said the Mule, finally. "It was wrong to have a third party present when I
    confronted you. It introduced one variable too many. It is a mistake that must be paid for, I
    suppose."

    He dropped the blaster carelessly, and kicked it to the other end of the room. Simultaneously,
    Pritcher crumpled into profound sleep.

    "He’ll be normal when he awakes," said the Mule, indifferently.

    The entire exchange from the time the Mule's thumb had begun pressing the trigger-contact to
    the time he dropped the blaster had occupied just under a second and a half of time.

    But just beneath the borders of consciousness, for a time just above the borders of detection,
    Channis caught a fugitive emotional gleam in the Mule's mind. And it was still one of sure and
    confident triumph.


    6

    One Man, the Mule - and Another

    Two men, apparently relaxed and entirely at ease, poles apart physically - with every nerve
    that served as emotional detector quivering tensely.

    The Mule, for the first time in long years, had insufficient surety of his own way. Channis knew
    that, though he could protect himself for the moment, it was an effort - and that the attack upon
    him was none such for his opponent. In a test of endurance, Channis knew he would lose.

    But it was deadly to think of that. To give away to the Mule an emotional weakness would be to
    hand him a weapon. There was already that glimpse of something - a winner's something - in
    the Mule's mind.

    To gain time-

    Why did the others delay? Was that the source of the Mule's confidence? What did his
    opponent know that he didn't? The mind he watched told nothing. If only he could read ideas.
    And yet-

    Channis braked his own mental whirling roughly. There was only that; to gain time-

    Channis said: "Since it is decided, and not denied by myself after our little duel over Pritcher,
    that I am a Second Foundationer, suppose you tell me why I came to Tazenda."

    "Oh, no," and the Mule laughed, with high-pitched confidence, "I am not Pritcher. I need make
    no explanations to you. You had what you thought were reasons. Whatever they were, your
    actions suited me, and so I inquire no further."



    "Yet there must be such gaps in your conception of the story. Is Tazenda the Second
    Foundation you expected to find? Pritcher spoke much of your other attempt at finding it, and of
    your psychologist tool, Ebling Mis. He babbled a bit sometimes under my ... uh ... slight
    encouragement. Think back on Ebling Mis, First Citizen."

    "Why should I?" Confidence!

    Channis felt that confidence edge out into the open, as if with the passage of time, any anxiety
    the Mule might be having was increasingly vanishing.

    He said, firmly restraining the rush of desperation: "You lack curiosity, then? Pritcher told me of
    Mis' vast surprise at something. There was his terribly drastic urging for speed, for a rapid
    warning of the Second Foundation? Why? Why? Ebling Mis died. The Second Foundation was
    not warned. And yet the Second Foundation exists."

    The Mule smiled in real pleasure, and with a sudden and surprising dash of cruelty that
    Channis felt advance and suddenly withdraw: "But apparently the Second Foundation was
    warned. Else how and why did one Bail Channis arrive on Kalgan to handle my men and to
    assume the rather thankless task of outwitting me. The warning came too late, that is all."

    "Then," and Channis allowed pity to drench outward from him, "you don't even know what the
    Second Foundation is, or anything of the deeper meaning of all that has been going on."

    To gain time!

    The Mule felt the other's pity, and his eyes narrowed with instant hostility. He rubbed his nose
    in his familiar four-fingered gesture, and snapped: "Amuse yourself, then. What o/The Second
    Foundation?"

    Channis spoke deliberately, in words rather than in emotional symbology. He said: "From what I
    have heard, it was the mystery that surrounded the Second Foundation that most puzzled Mis.
    Hari Seldon founded his two units so differently. The First Foundation was a splurge that in two
    centuries dazzled half the Galaxy. And the Second was an abyss that was dark.

    "You won't understand why that was, unless you can once again feel the intellectual
    atmosphere of the days of the dying Empire. It was a time of absolutes, of the great final
    generalities, at least in thought. It was a sign of decaying culture, of course, that dams had
    been built against the further development of ideas. It was his revolt against these dams that
    made Seldon famous. It was that one last spark of youthful creation in him that lit the Empire in
    a sunset glow and dimly foreshadowed the rising sun of the Second Empire."

    "Very dramatic. So what?"

    "So he created his Foundations according to the laws of psychohistory, but who knew better
    than he that even those laws were relative. He never created a finished product. Finished
    products are for decadent minds. His was an evolving mechanism and the Second Foundation
    was the instrument of that evolution. We, First Citizen of your Temporary Union of Worlds, we
    are the guardians of Seldon's Plan. Only we!"

    "Are you trying to talk yourself into courage," inquired the Mule, contemptuously, "or are you



    trying to impress me? For the Second Foundation, Seldon's Plan, the Second Empire all
    impresses me not the least, nor touches any spring of compassion, sympathy, responsibility,
    nor any other source of emotional aid you may be trying to tap in me. And in any case, poor
    fool, speak of the Second Foundation in the past tense, for it is destroyed."

    Channis felt the emotional potential that pressed upon his mind rise in intensity as the Mule
    rose from his chair and approached. Fie fought back furiously, but something crept relentlessly
    on within him, battering and bending his mind back - and back.

    Fie felt the wall behind him, and the Mule faced him, skinny arms akimbo, lips smiling terribly
    beneath that mountain of nose.

    The Mule said: "Your game is through, Channis. The game of all of you-of all the men of what
    used to be the Second Foundation. Used to be! Used to be!

    "What were you sitting here waiting for all this time, with your babble to Pritcher, when you
    might have struck him down and taken the blaster from him without the least effort of physical
    force? You were waiting for me, weren't you, waiting to greet me in a situation that would not
    too arouse my suspicions.

    "Too bad for you that I needed no arousal. I knew you. I knew you well, Channis of the Second
    Foundation.

    "But what are you waiting for now? You still throw words at me desperately, as though the mere
    sound of your voice would freeze me to my seat. And all the while you speak, something in
    your mind is waiting and waiting and is still waiting. But no one is coming. None of those you
    expect - none of your allies. You are alone here, Channis, and you will remain alone. Do you
    know why?

    "It is because your Second Foundation miscalculated me to the very dregs of the end. I knew
    their plan early. They thought I would follow you here and be proper meat for their cooking. You
    were to be a decoy indeed - a decoy for a poor, foolish weakling mutant, so hot on the trail of
    Empire that he would fall blindly into an obvious pit. But am I their prisoner?

    "I wonder if it occurred to them that I’d scarcely be here without my fleet - against the artillery of
    any unit of which they are entirely and pitifully helpless? Did it occur to them that I would not
    pause for discussion or wait for events?

    "My ships were launched against Tazenda twelve hours ago and they are quite, quite through
    with their mission. Tazenda is laid in ruins; its centers of population are wiped out. There was
    no resistance. The Second Foundation no longer exists, Channis - and I, the queer, ugly
    weakling, am the ruler of the Galaxy."

    Channis could do nothing but shake his head feebly. "No- No-"

    "Yes- Yes-" mimicked the Mule. "And if you are the last one alive, and you may be, that will not
    be for long either."

    And then there followed a short, pregnant pause, and Channis almost howled with the sudden
    pain of that tearing penetration of the innermost tissues of his mind.



    The Mule drew back and muttered: "Not enough. You do not pass the test after all. Your
    despair is pretense. Your fear is not the broad overwhelming that adheres to the destruction of
    an ideal, but the puny seeping fear of personal destruction."

    And the Mule’s weak hand seized Channis by the throat in a puny grip that Channis was
    somehow unable to break.

    "You are my insurance, Channis. You are my director and safeguard against any
    underestimation I may make." The Mule's eyes bore down upon him. Insistent- Demanding-

    "Have I calculated rightly, Channis? Have I outwitted your men of the Second Foundation?
    Tazenda is destroyed, Channis, tremendously destroyed; so why is your despair pretense?
    Where is the reality? I must have reality and truth! Talk, Channis talk. Have I penetrated then,
    not deeply enough? Does the danger still exist? Talk, Channis. Where have I done wrong?"

    Channis felt the words drag out of his mouth. They did not come willingly. He clenched his teeth
    against them. He bit his tongue. He tensed every muscle of his throat.

    And they came out - gasping - pulled out by force and tearing his throat and tongue and teeth
    on the way.

    "Truth," he squeaked, "truth-"

    "Yes, truth. What is left to be done?"

    "Seldon founded Second Foundation here. Here, as I said. I told no lie. The psychologists
    arrived and took control of the native population."

    "Of Tazenda?" The Mule plunged deeply into the flooding torture of the other's emotional
    upwellings - tearing at them brutally. "It is Tazenda I have destroyed. You know what I want.
    Give it to me."

    "Not Tazenda. I said Second Foundationers might not be those apparently in power; Tazenda
    is the figurehead-" The words were almost unrecognizable, forming themselves against every
    atom of will of the Second Foundationer, "Rossem- Rossem- Rossem is the world-"

    The Mule loosed his grip and Channis dropped into a huddle of pain and torture.

    "And you thought to fool me?" said the Mule, softly.

    "You were fooled." It was the last dying shred of resistance in Channis.

    "But not long enough for you and yours. I am in communication with my Fleet. And after
    Tazenda can come Rossem. But first-"

    Channis felt the excruciating darkness rise against him, and the automatic lift of his arm to his
    tortured eyes could not ward it off. It was a darkness that throttled, and as he felt his tom,
    wounded mind reeling backwards, backwards into the everlasting black - there was that final
    picture of the triumphant Mule - laughing matchstick - that long, fleshy nose quivering with
    laughter.



    The sound faded away. The darkness embraced him lovingly.

    It ended with a cracking sensation that was like the jagged glare of a lightning flash, and
    Channis came slowly to earth while sight returned painfully in blurry transmission through
    tear-drenched eyes.

    His head ached unbearably, and it was only with a stab of agony that he could bring up a hand
    to it.

    Obviously, he was alive. Softly, like feathers caught up in an eddy of air that had passed, his
    thoughts steadied and drifted to rest. He felt comfort suck in - from outside. Slowly, torturedly,
    he bent his neck - and relief was a sharp pang.

    For the door was open; and the First Speaker stood just inside the threshold. He tried to speak,
    to shout, to warn - but his tongue froze and he knew that a part of the Mule's mighty mind still
    held him and clamped all speech within him.

    He bent his neck once more. The Mule was still in the room. He was angry and hot-eyed. He
    laughed no longer, but his teeth were bared in a ferocious smile.

    Channis felt the First Speaker's mental influence moving gently over his mind with a healing
    touch and then there was the numbing sensation as it came into contact with the Mule's
    defense for an instant of struggle and withdrew.

    The Mule said gratingly, with a fury that was grotesque in his meagre body: "Then another
    comes to greet me." His agile mind reached its tendrils out of the room- out- out-

    "You are alone," he said.

    And the First Speaker interrupted with an acquiescence: "I am thoroughly alone. It is necessary
    that I be alone, since it was I who miscalculated your future five years ago. There would be a
    certain satisfaction to me in correcting that matter without aid. Unfortunately, I did not count on
    the strength of your Field of Emotional Repulsion that surrounded this place. It took me long to
    penetrate. I congratulate you upon the skill with which it was constructed."

    "Thank you for nothing," came the hostile rejoinder. "Bandy no compliments with me. Have you
    come to add your brain splinter to that of yonder cracked pillar of your realm?"

    The First Speaker smiled: "Why, the man you call Bail Channis performed his mission well, the
    more so since he was not your mental equal by far. I can see, of course, that you have
    mistreated him, yet it may be that we may restore him fully even yet. He is a brave man, sir. He
    volunteered for this mission although we were able to predict mathematically the huge chance
    of damage to his mind - a more fearful alternative than that of mere physical crippling."

    Channis' mind pulsed futilely with what he wanted to say and couldn't; the warning he wished to
    shout and was unable to. He could only emit that continuous stream of fear- fear-

    The Mule was calm. "You know, of course, of the destruction of Tazenda."

    "I do. The assault by your fleet was foreseen."



    Grimly: "Yes, so I suppose. But not prevented, eh?"

    "No, not prevented." The First Speaker's emotional symbology was plain. It was almost a
    self-horror; a complete self-disgust: "And the fault is much more mine than yours. Who could
    have imagined your powers five years ago. We suspected from the start - from the moment
    you captured Kalgan - that you had the powers of emotional control. That was not too
    surprising, First Citizen, as I can explain to you.

    "Emotional contact such as you and I possess is not a very new development. Actually it is
    implicit in the human brain. Most humans can read emotion in a primitive manner by
    associating it pragmatically with facial expression, tone of voice and so on. A good many
    animals possess the faculty to a higher degree; they use the sense of smell to a good extent
    and the emotions involved are, of course, less complex.

    "Actually, humans are capable of much more, but the faculty of direct emotional contact tended
    to atrophy with the development of speech a million years back. It has been the great advance
    of our Second Foundation that this forgotten sense has been restored to at least some of its
    potentialities.

    "But we are not born with its full use. A million years of decay is a formidable obstacle, and we
    must educate the sense, exercise it as we exercise our muscles. And there you have the main
    difference. You were born with it.

    "So much we could calculate. We could also calculate the effect of such a sense upon a person
    in a world of men who did not possess it. The seeing man in the kingdom of the blind- We
    calculated the extent to which a megalomania would take control of you and we thought we
    were prepared. But for two factors we were not prepared.

    "The first was the great extent of your sense. We can induce emotional contact only when in
    eyeshot, which is why we are more helpless against physical weapons than you might think.
    Sight plays such an enormous part. Not so with you. You are definitely known to have had men
    under control, and, further, to have had intimate emotional contact with them when out of sight
    and out of earshot. That was discovered too late.

    "Secondly, we did not know of your physical shortcomings, particularly the one that seemed so
    important to you, that you adopted the name of the Mule. We didn't foresee that you were not
    merely a mutant, but a sterile mutant and the added psychic distortion due to your inferiority
    complex passed us by. We allowed only for a megalomania - not for an intensely psychopathic
    paranoia as well.

    "It is myself that bears the responsibility for having missed all that, for I was the leader of the
    Second Foundation when you captured Kalgan. When you destroyed the First Foundation, we
    found out - but too late - and for that fault millions have died on Tazenda."

    "And you will correct things now?" The Mules thin lips curled, his mind pulsing with hate: "What
    will you do? Fatten me? Restore me to a masculine vigor? Take away from my past the long
    childhood in an alien environment. Do you regret my sufferings? Do you regret my
    unhappiness? I have no sorrow for what I did in my necessity. Let the Galaxy Protect itself as
    best it can, since it stirred not a whit for my protection when I needed it."



    Your emotions are, of course," said the First Speaker, "only the children of your background
    and are not to be condemned - merely changed. The destruction of Tazenda was unavoidable.
    The alternative would have been a much greater destruction generally throughout the Galaxy
    over a period of centuries. We did our best in our limited way. We withdrew as many men from
    Tazenda as we could. We decentralized the rest of the world. Unfortunately, our measures
    were of necessity far from adequate. It left many millions to die - do you not regret that?"

    "Not at all - any more than I regret the hundred thousand that must die on Rossem in not more
    than six hours."

    "On Rossem?" said the First Speaker, quickly.

    Fie turned to Channis who had forced himself into a half-sitting posture, and his mind exerted
    its force. Channis, felt the duel of minds strain over him, and then there was a short snapping of
    the bond and the words came tumbling out of his mouth: "Sir, I have failed completely. He
    forced it from me not ten minutes before your arrival. I could not resist him and I offer no
    excuses. He knows Tazenda is not the Second Foundation. He knows that Rossem is."

    And the bonds closed down upon him again.

    The First Speaker frowned: "I see. What is it you are planning to do?"

    "Do you really wonder? Do you really find it difficult to penetrate the obvious? All this time that
    you have preached to me of the nature of emotional contact - all this time that you have been
    throwing words such as megalomania and paranoia at me, I have been working. I have been in
    contact with my Fleet and it has its orders. In six hours, unless I should for some reason
    counteract my orders, they are to bombard all of Rossem except this lone village and an area
    of a hundred square miles about it. They are to do a thorough job and are then to land here.

    "You have six hours, and in six hours, you cannot beat down my mind, nor can you save the
    rest of Rossem."

    The Mule spread his hands and laughed again while the First Speaker seemed to find difficulty
    in absorbing this new state of affairs.

    He said: "The alternative?"

    "Why should there even be an alternative? I can stand to gain no more by any alternative. Is it
    the lives of those on Rossem I'm to be chary of? Perhaps if you allow my ships to land and
    submit, all of you - all the men on the Second Foundation - to mental control sufficient to suit
    myself, I may countermand the bombardment orders. It may be worthwhile to put so many men
    of high intelligence under my control. But then again it would be a considerable effort and
    perhaps not worth it after all, so I'm not particularly eager to have you agree to it. What do you
    say, Second Foundationer? What weapon have you against my mind which is as strong as
    yours at least and against my ships which are stronger than anything you have ever dreamed
    of possessing?"

    "What have I?" repeated the First Speaker, slowly: "Why nothing - except a little grain - such a
    little grain of knowledge that even yet you do not possess."



    "Speak quickly," laughed the Mule, "speak inventively. For squirm as you might, you won't
    squirm out of this."

    "Poor mutant," said the First Speaker, "I have nothing to squirm out of. Ask yourself - why was
    Bail Channis sent to Kalgan as a decoy - Bail Channis, who though young and brave is almost
    as much your mental inferior as is this sleeping officer of yours, this Han Pritcher. Why did not I
    go, or another of our leaders, who would be more your match?"

    "Perhaps," came the supremely confident reply, "you were not sufficiently foolish, since
    perhaps none of you are my match."

    "The true reason is more logical. You knew Channis to be a Second Foundationer. He lacked
    the capacity to hide that from you. And you knew, too, that you were his superior, so you were
    not afraid to play his game and follow him as he wished you to in order to outwit him later. Had I
    gone to Kalgan, you would have killed me for I would have been a real danger, or had I avoided
    death by concealing my identity, I would yet have failed in persuading you to follow me into
    space. It was only known inferiority that lured you on. And had you remained on Kalgan, not all
    the force of the Second Foundation could have harmed you, surrounded as you were by your
    men, your machines, and your mental power."

    "My mental power is yet with me, squirmer," said the Mule, "and my men and machines are not
    far off."

    "Truly so, but you are not on Kalgan. You are here in the Kingdom of Tazenda, logically
    presented to you as the Second Foundation - very logically presented. It had to be so
    presented, for you are a wise man, First Citizen, and would follow only logic."

    "Correct, and it was a momentary victory for your side, but there was still time for me to worm
    the truth from your man, Channis, and still wisdom in me to realize that such a truth might
    exist."

    "And on our side, oh, not-quite-sufficiently-subtle one, was the realization that you might go that
    one step further and so Bail Channis was prepared for you."

    "That he most certainly was not, for I stripped his brain clean as any plucked chicken. It
    quivered bare and open before me and when he said Rossem was the Second Foundation, it
    was basic truth for I had ground him so flat and smooth that not the smidgeon of a deceit could
    have found refuge in any microscopic crevice."

    "True enough. So much the better for our foresight. For I have told you already that Bail
    Channis was a volunteer. Do you know what sort of a volunteer? Before he left our Foundation
    for Kalgan and you, he submitted to emotional surgery of a drastic nature. Do you think it was
    sufficient to deceive you? Do you think Bail Channis, mentally untouched, could possibly
    deceive you? No, Bail Channis was himself deceived, of necessity and voluntarily. Down to the
    inmost core of his mind, Bail Channis honestly believes that Rossem is the Second Foundation.

    "And for three years now, we of the Second Foundation have built up the appearance of that
    here in the Kingdom of Tazenda, in preparation and waiting for you. And we have succeeded,
    have we not? You penetrated to Tazenda, and beyond that, to Rossem - but past that, you



    could not go."

    The Mule was upon his feet: "You dare tell me that Rossem also, is not the Second
    Foundation?"

    Channis, from the floor, felt his bonds burst for good, under a stream of mental force on the part
    of the First Speaker and strained upright. Fie let out one long, incredulous cry: "You mean
    Rossem is not the Second Foundation?"

    The memories of life, the knowledge of his mind - everything - whirled mistily about him in
    confusion.

    The First Speaker smiled: "You see, First Citizen, Channis is as upset as you are. Of course,
    Rossem is not the Second Foundation. Are we madmen then, to lead you, our greatest, most
    powerful, most dangerous enemy to our own world? Oh, no!

    "Let your Fleet bombard Rossem, First Citizen, if you must have it so. Let them destroy all they
    can. For at most they can kill only Channis and myself - and that will leave you in a situation
    improved not in the least.

    "For the Second Foundation's Expedition to Rossem which has been here for three years and
    has functioned, temporarily, as Elders in this village, embarked yesterday and are returning to
    Kalgan. They will evade your Fleet, of course, and they will arrive in Kalgan at least a day
    before you can, which is why I tell you all this. Unless I countermand my orders, when you
    return, you will find a revolting Empire, a disintegrated realm, and only the men with you in your
    Fleet here will be loyal to you. They will be hopelessly outnumbered. And moreover, the men of
    the Second Foundation will be with your Flome Fleet and will see to it that you reconvert no
    one. Your Empire is done, mutant."

    Slowly, the Mule bowed his head, as anger and despair cornered his mind completely, "Yes.
    Too late- Too late- Now I see it."

    "Now you see it," agreed the First Speaker, "and now you don't."

    In the despair of that moment, when the Mule's mind lay open, the First Speaker - ready for
    that moment and pre-sure of its nature - entered quickly. It required a rather insignificant
    fraction of a second to consummate the change completely.

    The Mule looked up and said: "Then I shall return to Kalgan?

    "Certainly. Flow do you feel?"

    "Excellently well." Flis brow puckered: "Who are you?"

    "Does it matter?"

    "Of course not." Fie dismissed the matter, and touched Pritcher's shoulder: "Wake up, Pritcher,
    we're going home."

    It was two hours later that Bail Channis felt strong enough to walk by himself. Fie said: "Fie
    won't ever remember?"



    "Never. He retains his mental powers and his Empire - but his motivations are now entirely
    different. The notion of a Second Foundation is a blank to him, and he is a man of peace. He
    will be a far happier man henceforward, too, for the few years of life left him by his maladjusted
    physique. And then, after he is dead Seldon's Plan will go on - somehow."

    "And it is true," urged Channis, "it is true that Rossem is not the Second Foundation? I could
    swear - I tell you I know it is. I am not mad."

    "You are not mad, Channis, merely, as I have said, changed. Rossem is not the Second
    Foundation. Come! We, too, will return home."

    LAST INTERLUDE

    Bail Channis sat in the small white-tiled room and allowed his mind to relax. He was content to
    live in the present. There were the walls and the window and the grass outside. They had no
    names. They were just things. There was a bed and a chair an books that developed
    themselves idly on the screen at the foot of his bed. There was the nurse who brought him his
    food.

    At first he had made efforts to piece together the scraps of things he had heard. Such as those
    two men talking together.

    One had said: "Complete aphasia now. It’s cleaned out, and I think without damage. It will only
    be necessary to return the recording of his original brain-wave makeup."

    He remembered the sounds by rote, and for some reason they seemed peculiar sounds - as if
    they meant something. But why bother.

    Better to watch the pretty changing colors on the screen at the foot of the thing he lay on.

    And then someone entered and did things to him and for a long time, he slept.

    And when that had passed, the bed was suddenly a bed and he knew he was in a hospital, and
    the words he remembered made sense.

    He sat up: "What's happening?"

    The First Speaker was beside him, "You're on the Second Foundation, and you have your mind
    back - your original mind."

    "Yes! Yes !" Channis came to the realization that he was himself, and there was incredible
    triumph and joy in that.

    "And now tell me," said the First Speaker, "do you know where the Second Foundation is now?"

    And the truth came flooding down in one enormous wave and Channis did not answer. Like
    Ebling Mis before him, he was conscious of only one vast, numbing surprise.

    Until he finally nodded, and said: "By the Stars of the Galaxy - now, I know."

    SEARCH BY THE FOUNDATION

    Arcadia

    DARELL, ARKADY novelist, born 1 1, 5, 362 F.E., died 1, 7, 443 F.E. Although primarily a writer
    of fiction, Arkady Darell is best known for her biography of her grandmother, Bayta Darell.

    Based on first-hand information, it has for centuries served as a primary source of information
    concerning the Mule and his times. ... Like "Unkeyed Memories", her novel "Time and Time and
    Over" is a stirring reflection of the brilliant Kalganian society of the early Interregnum, based, it
    is said, on a visit to Kalgan in her youth....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Arcadia Darell declaimed firmly into the mouthpiece of her transcriber:

    "The Future of Seldon's Plan, by A. Darell" and then thought darkly that some day when she
    was a great writer, she would write all her masterpieces under the pseudonym of Arkady. Just
    Arkady. No last name at all.

    "A. Darell" would be just the sort of thing that she would have to put on all her themes for her
    class in Composition and Rhetoric - so tasteless. All the other kids had to do it, too, except for
    Olynthus Dam, because the class laughed so when he did it the first time, And "Arcadia" was a
    little girls name, wished on her because her great-grandmother had been called that; her
    parents just had no imagination at all.

    Now that she was two days past fourteen, you'd think they'd recognize the simple fact of
    adulthood and call her Arkady. Her lips tightened as she thought of her father looking up from
    his book-viewer just long enough to say, "But if you're going to pretend you're nineteen,

    Arcadia, what will you do when you're twenty-five and all the boys think you're thirty?"

    From where she sprawled across the arms and into the hollow of her own special armchair, she
    could see the mirror on her dresser. Her foot was a little in the way because her house slipper
    kept twirling about her big toe, so she pulled it in and sat up with an unnatural straightness to
    her neck that she felt sure, somehow, lengthened it a full two inches into slim regality.

    For a moment, she considered her face thoughtfully - too fat. She opened her jaws half an inch
    behind closed lips, and caught the resultant trace of unnatural gauntness at every angle. She
    licked her lips with a quick touch of tongue and let them pout a bit in moist softness. Then she
    let her eyelids droop in a weary, worldly way- Oh, golly if only her cheeks weren't that silly pink.




    She tried putting her fingers to the outer comers of her eye and tilting the lids a bit to get that
    mysterious exotic languor of the women of the inner star systems, but her hands were in the
    way and she couldn't see her face very well.

    Then she lifted her chin, caught herself at a half-profile, and with her eyes a little strained from
    looking out the comer and her neck muscles faintly aching, she said, in a voice one octave
    below its natural pitch, "Really, father, if you think it makes a particle of difference to me what
    some silly old boys think you just-"

    And then she remembered that she still had the transmitter open in her hand and said, drearily,
    "Oh, golly," and shut it off.

    The faintly violet paper with the peach margin line on the left had upon it the following:

    "THE FUTURE OF SELDON'S PLAN

    "Really, father, if you think it makes a particle of difference to me what some silly old boys think
    you just

    "Oh, golly."

    She pulled the sheet out of the machine with annoyance and another clicked neatly into place.

    But her face smoothed out of its vexation, nevertheless, and her wide, little mouth stretched
    into a self-satisfied smile. She sniffed at the paper delicately, just right. Just that proper touch of
    elegance and charm. And the penmanship was just the last word.

    The machine had been delivered two days ago on her first adult birthday. She had said, "But
    father, everybody - just everybody in the class who has the slightest pretensions to being
    anybody has one. Nobody but some old drips would use hand machines-"

    The salesman had said, "There is no other model as compact on the one hand and as
    adaptable on the other. It will spell and punctuate correctly according to the sense of the
    sentence. Naturally, it is a great aid to education since it encourages the user to employ careful
    enunciation and breathing in order to make sure of the correct spelling, to say nothing of
    demanding a proper and elegant delivery for correct punctuation."

    Even then her father had tried to get one geared for type-print as if she were some dried-up,
    old-maid teacher.

    But when it was delivered, it was the model she wanted - obtained perhaps with a little more
    wail and sniffle than quite went with the adulthood of fourteen - and copy was turned out in a
    charming and entirely feminine handwriting, with the most beautifully graceful capitals anyone
    ever saw.

    Even the phrase, "Oh, golly." somehow breathed glamour when the Transcriber was done with
    it.

    But just the same she had to get it right, so she sat up straight in her chair, placed her first draft
    before her in businesslike fashion, and began again, crisply and clearly; her abdomen flat, her
    chest lifted, and her breathing carefully controlled. She intoned, with dramatic fervor:



    The Future of Seldon's Plan.


    "The Foundation's past history is, I am sure, well-known to all of us who have had the good
    fortune to be educated in our planet's efficient and well-staffed school system.

    (There! That would start things off right with Miss Erlking, that mean old hag.)

    That past history is largely the past history of the great Plan of Hari Seldon. The two are one.
    But the question in the mind of most people today is whether this Plan will continue in all its
    great wisdom, or whether it will be foully destroyed, or, perhaps, has been so destroyed
    already.

    "To understand this, it may be best to pass quickly over some of the highlights of the Plan as it
    has been revealed to humanity thus far.

    (This part was easy because she had taken Modern History the semester before.)

    "In the days, nearly four centuries ago, when the First Galactic Empire was decaying into the
    paralysis that preceded final death, one man - the great Hari Seldon - foresaw the
    approaching end. Through the science of psychohistory, the intrissacies of whose mathematics
    has long since been forgotten,

    (She paused in a trifle of doubt. She was sure that "intricacies" was pronounced with soft c's
    but the spelling didn't look right. Oh, well, the machine couldn't very well be wrong-)

    he and the men who worked with him are able to foretell the course of the great social and
    economic currents sweeping the Galaxy at the time. It was possible for them to realize that, left
    to itself, the Empire would break up, and that thereafter there would be at least thirty thousand
    years of anarchic chaos prior to the establishment of a new Empire.

    "It was too late to prevent the great Fall, but it was still possible, at least, to cut short the
    intermediate period of chaos. The Plan was, therefore, evolved whereby only a single
    millennium would separate the Second Empire from the First. We are completing the fourth
    century of that millennium, and many generations of men have lived and died while the Plan
    has continued its inexorable workings.

    "Hari Seldon established two Foundations at the opposite ends of the Galaxy, in a manner and
    under such circumstances as would yield the best mathematical solution for his
    psychohistorical problem. In one of these, our Foundation, established here on Terminus, there
    was concentrated the physical science of the Empire, and through the possession of that
    science, the Foundation was able to withstand the attacks of the barbarous kingdoms which
    had broken away and become independent, out at the hinge of the Empire.

    "The Foundation, indeed, was able to conquer in its turn these short-lived kingdoms by means
    of the leadership of a series of wise and heroic men like Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow who
    were able to interpret the Plan intelligently and to guide our land through its

    (She had written "intricacies" here also, but decided not to risk it a second time.)

    complications. All our planets still revere their memories although centuries have passed.



    "Eventually, the Foundation established a commercial system which controlled a large portion
    of the Siwennian and Anacreonian sectors of the Galaxy, and even defeated the remnants of
    the old Empire under its last great general, Bel Riose. It seemed that nothing could now stop
    the workings of Seldon's plan. Every crisis that Seldon had planned had come at its appropriate
    time and had been solved, and with each solution the Foundation had taken another giant
    stride toward Second Empire and peace.

    "And then,

    (Her breath came short at this point, and she hissed the word, between her teeth, but the
    Transmitter simply wrote them calmly and gracefully.)

    with the last remnants of the dead First Empire gone and with only ineffectual warlords ruling
    over the splinters and remnants of the decayed colossus,

    (She got that phrase out of a thriller on the video last week, but old Miss Erlking never listened
    to anything but symphonies and lectures, so she'd never know.)

    there came the Mule.

    "This strange man was not allowed for in the Plan. Fie was a mutant, whose birth could not
    have been predicted. Fie had strange and mysterious power of controlling and manipulating
    human emotions and in this manner could bend all men to his will. With breath-taking swiftness,
    he became a conqueror and Empire-builder, until, finally, he even defeated the Foundation
    itself.

    "Yet he never obtained universal dominion, since in his first overpowering lunge he was
    stopped by the wisdom and daring of a great woman

    (Now there was that old problem again. Father would insist that she never bring up the fact that
    she was the grandchild of Bayta Darell. Everyone knew it and Bayta was just about the greatest
    woman there ever was and she had stopped the Mule singlehanded.)

    in a manner the true story of which is known in its entirety to very few.

    (There! If she had to read it to the class, that last could he said in a dark voice, and someone
    would be sure to ask what the true story was, and then - well, and then she couldn't help tell
    the truth if they asked her, could she? In her mind, she was already wordlessly whizzing
    through a hurt and eloquent explanation to a stern and questioning paternal parent.)

    "After five years of restricted rule, another change took place, the reasons for which are not
    known, and the Mule abandoned all plans for further conquest. His last five years were those of
    an enlightened despot.

    "It is said by some that the change in the Mule was brought about by the intervention of the
    Second Foundation. Flowever, no man has ever discovered the exact location of this other
    Foundation, nor knows its exact function, so that theory remains unproven.

    "A whole generation has passed since the death of the Mule. What of the future, then, now that
    he has come and gone? Fie interrupted Seldon's Plan and seemed to have burst it to



    fragments, yet as soon as he died, the Foundation rose again, like a nova from the dead ashes
    of a dying star.

    (She had made that up herself.)

    Once again, the planet Terminus houses the center of a commercial federation almost as great
    and as rich as before the conquest, and even more peaceful and democratic.

    "Is this planned? Is Seldon's great dream still alive, and will a Second Galactic Empire yet be
    formed six hundred years from now? I, myself, believe so, because

    (This was the important part. Miss Erlking always had those large, ugly red-pencil scrawls that
    went: 'But this is only descriptive. What are your personal reactions? Think! Express yourself!
    Penetrate your own soul!' Penetrate your own soul. A lot she knew about souls, with her lemon
    face that never smiled in its life-)

    never at any time has the political situation been so favorable. The old Empire is completely
    dead and the period of the Mule's rule put an end to the era of warlords that preceded him.
    Most of the surrounding portions of the Galaxy are civilized and peaceful.

    "Moreover the internal health of the Foundation is better than ever before. The despotic times
    of the pre-Conquest hereditary mayors have given way to the democratic elections of early
    times. There are no longer dissident worlds of independent Traders; no longer the injustices
    and dislocations that accompanied accumulations of great wealth in the hands of a few.

    "There is no reason, therefore, to fear failure, unless it is true that the Second Foundation itself
    presents a danger. Those who think so have no evidence to back their claim, but merely vague
    fears and superstitions. I think that our confidence in ourselves, in our nation, and in Hari
    Seldon's great Plan should drive from our hearts and minds all uncertainties and

    (Hm-m-m. This was awfully corny, but something like this was expected at the end.)

    so I say-"

    That is as far as "The Future of Seldon's Plan" got, at that moment, because there was the
    gentlest little tap on the window, and when Arcadia shot up to a balance on one arm of the
    chair, she found herself confronted by a smiling face beyond the glass, its even symmetry of
    feature interestingly accentuated by the short, vertical fine of a finger before its lips.

    With the slight pause necessary to assume an attitude of bepuzzlement, Arcadia dismounted
    from the armchair, walked to the couch that fronted the wide window that held the apparition
    and, kneeling upon it, stared out thoughtfully.

    The smile upon the man's face faded quickly. While the fingers of one hand tightened whitely
    upon the sill, the other made a quick gesture. Arcadia obeyed calmly, and closed the latch that
    moved the lower third of the window smoothly into its socket in the wall, allowing the warm
    spring air to interfere with the conditioning within.

    "You can't get in," she said, with comfortable smugness. "The windows are all screened, and
    keyed only to people who belong here. If you come in, all sorts of alarms will break loose." A



    pause, then she added, "You look sort of silly balancing on that ledge underneath the window.

    If you're not careful, you'll fall and break your neck and a lot of valuable flowers."

    "In that case," said the man at the window, who had been thinking that very thing - with a
    slightly different arrangement of adjectives- "will you shut off the screen and let me in?"

    "No use in doing that'" said Arcadia. "You're probably thinking of a different house, because I'm
    not the kind of girl who lets strange men into their ... her bedroom this time of night." Her eyes,
    as she said it, took on a heavy-lidded sultriness - or an unreasonable facsimile thereof.

    All traces of humor whatever had disappeared from the young stranger's face. He muttered,
    "This is Dr. Darell's house, isn't it?"

    "Why should I tell you?"

    "Oh, Galaxy- Good-by-"

    "If you jump off, young man, I will personally give the alarm." (This was intended as a refined
    and sophisticated thrust of irony, since to Arcadia's enlightened eyes, the intruder was an
    obviously mature thirty, at least - quite elderly, in fact.)

    Quite a pause. Then, tightly, he said, "Well, now, look here, girlie, if you don't want me to stay,
    and don't want me to go, what do you want me to do?"

    "You can come in, I suppose. Dr. Darell does live here. I’ll shut off the screen now."

    Warily, after a searching look, the young man poked his hand through the window, then
    hunched himself up and through it. He brushed at his knees with an angry, slapping gesture,
    and lifted a reddened face at her.

    "You're quite sure that your character and reputation won't suffer when they find me here, are
    you?"

    "Not as much as yours would, because just as soon as I hear footsteps outside, I'll just shout
    and yell and say you forced your way in here."

    "Yes?" he replied with heavy courtesy, "And how do you intend to explain the shut-off protective
    screen?"

    "Poof! That would be easy. There wasn't any there in the first place."

    The man's eyes were wide with chagrin. "That was a bluff? How old are you, kid?"

    "I consider that a very impertinent question, young man. And I am not accustomed to being
    addressed as 'kid.'"

    "I don't wonder. You're probably the Mule's grandmother in disguise. Do you mind if I leave now
    before you arrange a lynching party with myself as star performer?"

    "You had better not leave - because my father's expecting you."

    The man's look became a wary one, again. An eyebrow shot up as he said, lightly, "Oh?



    Anyone with your father?'

    "No."

    "Anyone called on him lately?'

    "Only tradespeople - and you."

    "Anything unusual happen at all?"

    "Only you."

    "Forget me, will you? No, don't forget me. Tell me, how did you know your father was expecting
    me?"

    "Oh, that was easy. Last week, he received a Personal Capsule, keyed to him personally, with
    a self-oxidizing message, you know. He threw the capsule shell into the Trash Disinto, and
    yesterday, he gave Poli - that's our maid, you see - a month's vacation so she could visit her
    sister in Terminus City, and this afternoon, he made up the bed in the spare room. So I knew
    he expected somebody that I wasn't supposed to know anything about. Usually, he tells me
    everything."

    "Really! I'm surprised he has to. I should think you'd know everything before he tells you."

    'I usually do." Then she laughed. She was beginning to feel very much at ease. The visitor was
    elderly, but very distinguished-looking with curly brown hair and very blue eyes. Maybe she
    could meet somebody like that again, sometimes, when she was old herself.

    "And just how," he asked, "did you know it was I he expected."

    "Well, who else could \\ be? He was expecting somebody in so secrety a way, if you know what
    I mean - and then you come gumping around trying to sneak through windows, instead of
    walking through the front door, the way you would if you had any sense." She remembered a
    favorite line, and used it promptly. "Men are so stupid!"

    "Pretty stuck on yourself, aren't you, kid? I mean, Miss. You could be wrong, you know. What if
    I told you that all this is a mystery to me and that as far as I know, your father is expecting
    someone else, not me."

    "Oh, I don't think so. I didn't ask you to come in, until after I saw you drop your briefcase."

    "My what?"

    "Your briefcase, young man. I'm not blind. You didn't drop it by accident, because you looked
    down first, so as to make sure it would land right. Then you must have realized it would land
    just under the hedges and wouldn't be seen, so you dropped it and didn't look down afterwards.
    Now since you came to the window instead of the front door, it must mean that you were a little
    afraid to trust yourself in the house before investigating the place. And after you had a little
    trouble with me, you took care of your briefcase before taking care of yourself, which means
    that you consider whatever your briefcase has in it to be more valuable than your own safety,
    and that means that as long as you're in here and the briefcase is out there and we know that



    it's out there, you're probably pretty helpless."

    She paused for a much-needed breath, and the man said, grittily, "Except that I think I'll choke
    you just about medium dead and get out of here, with the briefcase."

    "Except, young man, that I happen to have a baseball bat under my bed, which I can reach in
    two seconds from where I'm sitting, and I'm very strong for a girl."

    Impasse. Finally, with a strained courtesy, the "young man" said, "Shall I introduce myself,
    since we're being so chummy. I'm Pelleas Anthor. And your name?"

    "I'm Area- Arkady Darell. Pleased to meet you."

    "And now Arkady, would you be a good little girl and call your father?"

    Arcadia bridled. "I'm not a little girl. I think you're very rude - especially when you're asking a
    favor."

    Pelleas Anthor sighed. "Very well. Would you be a good, kind, dear, little old lady, just chock full
    of lavender, and call your father?"

    "That's not what I meant either, but I’ll call him. Only not so I'll take my eyes off you , young
    man." And she stamped on the floor.

    There came the sound of hurrying footsteps in the hall, and the door was flung open.

    "Arcadia-" There was a tiny explosion of exhaled air, and Dr. Darell said, "Who are you, sir?"

    Pelleas sprang to his feet in what was quite obviously relief. "Dr. Toran Darell? I am Pelleas
    Anthor. You've received word about me, I think. At least, your daughter says you have."

    "My daughter says I have?" He bent a frowning glance at her which caromed harmlessly off the
    wide-eyed and impenetrable web of innocence with which she met the accusation.

    Dr. Darell said, finally: "I have been expecting you. Would you mind coming down with me,
    please?" And he stopped as his eye caught a flicker of motion, which Arcadia caught
    simultaneously.

    She scrambled toward her Transcriber, but it was quite useless, since her father was standing
    right next to it. He said, sweetly, "You've left it going all this time, Arcadia."

    "Father," she squeaked, in real anguish, "it is very ungentlemanly to read another person's
    private correspondence, especially when it's talking correspondence."

    "Ah," said her father, "but 'talking correspondence' with a strange man in your bedroom! As a
    father, Arcadia, I must protect you against evil."

    "Oh, golly - it was nothing like that."

    Pelleas laughed suddenly, "Oh, but it was, Dr. Darell. The young lady was going to accuse me
    of all sorts of things, and I must insist that you read it, if only to clear my name."


    Oh-" Arcadia held back her tears with an effort. Her own father didn't even trust her. And that



    darned Transcriber- If that silly fool hadn't come gooping at the window, and making her forget
    to turn it off. And now her father would be making long, gentle speeches about what young
    ladies aren't supposed to do. There just wasn't anything they were supposed to do, it looked
    like, except choke and die, maybe.

    "Arcadia," said her father, gently, "it strikes me that a young lady-"

    She knew it. She knew it.

    "-should not be quite so impertinent to men older than she is.

    "Well, what did he want to come peeping around my window for? A young lady has a right to
    privacy- Now I'll have to do my whole darned composition over."

    "It's not up to you to question his propriety in coming to your window. You should simply not
    have let him in. You should have called me instantly - especially if you thought I was expecting
    him."

    She said, peevishly, "It's just as well if you didn't see him - stupid thing. Hell give the whole
    thing away if he keeps on going to windows, instead of doors."

    "Arcadia, nobody wants your opinion on matters you know nothing of."

    "I do, too. It's the Second Foundation, that's what it is."

    There was a silence. Even Arcadia felt a little nervous stirring in her abdomen.

    Dr. Darell said, softly, "Where have you heard this?"

    "Nowheres, but what else is there to be so secret about? And you don't have to worry that I’ll
    tell anyone."

    "Mr. Anthor," said Dr. Darell, "I must apologize for all this."

    "Oh, that's all right," came Anthor's rather hollow response. "It's not your fault if she's sold
    herself to the forces of darkness. But do you mind if I ask her a question before we go. Miss
    Arcadia-"

    "What do you want?"

    "Why do you think it is stupid to go to windows instead of to doors?"

    "Because you advertise what you're trying to hide, silly. If I have a secret, I don't put tape over
    my mouth and let everyone know I have a secret. I talk just as much as usual, only about
    something else. Didn't you ever read any of the sayings of Salvor Hardin? He was our first
    Mayor, you know."

    "Yes, I know."

    "Well, he used to say that only a he that wasn't ashamed of itself could possibly succeed. He
    also said that nothing had to be true, but everything had to sound true. Well, when you come in
    through a window, it's a lie that's ashamed of itself and it doesn't sound true."



    "Then what would you have done?"

    "If I had wanted to see my father on top secret business, I would have made his acquaintance
    openly and seen him about all sorts of strictly legitimate things. And then when everyone knew
    all about you and connected you with my father as a matter of course, you could be as top
    secret as you want and nobody would ever think of questioning it."

    Anthor looked at the girl strangely, then at Dr. Darell. He said, "Let's go. I have a briefcase I
    want to pick up in the garden. Wait! Just one last question. Arcadia, you don't really have a
    baseball bat under your bed, do you?"

    "No! I don't."

    "Hah. I didn't think so."

    Dr. Darell stopped at the door. "Arcadia," he said, "when you rewrite your composition on the
    Seldon Plan, don't be unnecessarily mysterious about your grandmother. There is no necessity
    to mention that part at all."

    He and Pelleas descended the stairs in silence. Then the visitor asked in a strained voice, "Do
    you mind, sir? How old is she?"

    "Fourteen, day before yesterday."

    "Fourteen? Great Galaxy- Tell me, has she ever said she expects to marry some day?"

    "No, she hasn't. Not to me."

    Well, if she ever does, shoot him. The one she's going to marry, I mean." He stared earnestly
    into the older man's eyes. "I'm serious. Life could hold no greater horror than living with what
    shell be like when she's twenty. I don't mean to offend you, of course."

    "You don't offend me. I think I know what you mean."

    Upstairs, the object of their tender analyses faced the Transcriber with revolted weariness and
    said, dully: "Thefutureofseldonsplan." The Transcriber with infinite aplomb, translated that into
    elegantly, complicated script capitals as:

    "The Future of Seldon's Plan."


    8

    Seldon's Plan

    MATHEMATICS The synthesis of the calculus of n-variables and of n-dimensional geometry is
    the basis of what Seldon once called "my little algebra of humanity"....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Consider a room!



    The location of the room is not in question at the moment. It is merely sufficient to say that in
    that room, more than anywhere, the Second Foundation existed.

    It was a room which, through the centuries, had been the abode of pure science - yet it had
    none of the gadgets with which, through millennia of association, science has come to be
    considered equivalent. It was a science, instead, which dealt with mathematical concepts only,
    in a manner similar to the speculation of ancient, ancient races in the primitive, prehistoric days
    before technology had come to be; before Man had spread beyond a single, now-unknown
    world.

    For one thing, there was in that room - protected by a mental science as yet unassailable by
    the combined physical might of the rest of the Galaxy - the Prime Radiant, which held in its
    vitals the Seldon Plan - complete.

    For another, there was a man, too, in that room - The First Speaker.

    Fie was the twelfth in the line of chief guardians of the Plan, and his title bore no deeper
    significance than the fact that at the gatherings of the leaders of the Second Foundation, he
    spoke first.

    His predecessor had beaten the Mule, but the wreckage of that gigantic struggle still littered the
    path of the Plan- For twenty-five years, he, and his administration, had been trying to force a
    Galaxy of stubborn and stupid human beings back to the path- It was a terrible task.

    The First Speaker looked up at the opening door. Even while, in the loneliness of the room, he
    considered his quarter century of effort, which now so slowly and inevitably approached its
    climax; even while he had been so engaged, his mind had been considering the newcomer with
    a gentle expectation. A youth, a student, one of those who might take over, eventually.

    The young man stood uncertainly at the door, so that the First Speaker had to walk to him and
    lead him in, with a friendly hand upon the shoulder.

    The Student smiled shyly, and the First Speaker responded by saying, "First, I must tell you
    why you are here."

    They faced each other now, across the desk. Neither was speaking in any way that could be
    recognized as such by any man in the Galaxy who was not himself a member of the Second
    Foundation.

    Speech, originally, was the device whereby Man learned, imperfectly, to transmit the thoughts
    and emotions of his mind. By setting up arbitrary sounds and combinations of sounds to
    represent certain mental nuances, be developed a method of communication - but one which
    in its clumsiness and thick-thumbed inadequacy degenerated all the delicacy of the mind into
    gross and guttural signaling.

    Down- down- the results can be followed; and all the suffering that humanity ever knew can be
    traced to the one fact that no man in the history of the Galaxy, until Hari Seldon, and very few
    men thereafter, could really understand one another. Every human being lived behind an
    impenetrable wall of choking mist within which no other but he existed. Occasionally there were
    the dim signals from deep within the cavern in which another man was located-so that each



    might grope toward the other. Yet because they did not know one another, and could not
    understand one another, and dared not trust one another, and felt from infancy the terrors and
    insecurity of that ultimate isolation - there was the hunted fear of man for man, the savage
    rapacity of man toward man.

    Feet, for tens of thousands of years, had clogged and shuffled in the mud - and held down the
    minds which, for an equal time, had been fit for the companionship of the stars.

    Grimly, Man had instinctively sought to circumvent the prison bars of ordinary speech.
    Semantics, symbolic logic, psychoanalysis - they had all been devices whereby speech could
    either be refined or by-passed.

    Psychohistory had been the development of mental science, the final mathematicization
    thereof, rather, which had finally succeeded. Through the development of the mathematics
    necessary to understand the facts of neural physiology and the electrochemistry of the nervous
    system, which themselves had to be, had to be, traced down to nuclear forces, it first became
    possible to truly develop psychology. And through the generalization of psychological
    knowledge from the individual to the group, sociology was also mathematicized.

    The larger groups; the billions that occupied planets; the trillions that occupied Sectors; the
    quadrillions that occupied the whole Galaxy, became, not simply human beings, but gigantic
    forces amenable to statistical treatment - so that to Hari Seldon, the future became clear and
    inevitable, and the Plan could be set up.

    The same basic developments of mental science that had brought about the development of
    the Seldon Plan, thus made it also unnecessary for the First Speaker to use words in
    addressing the Student.

    Every reaction to a stimulus, however slight, was completely indicative of all the trifling
    changes, of all the flickering currents that went on in another's mind. The First Speaker could
    not sense the emotional content of the Student's instinctively, as the Mule would have been
    able to do - since the Mule was a mutant with powers not ever likely to become completely
    comprehensible to any ordinary man, even a Second Foundationer - rather he deduced them,
    as the result of intensive training.

    Since, however, it is inherently impossible in a society based on speech to indicate truly the
    method of communication of Second Foundationers among themselves, the whole matter will
    be hereafter ignored. The First Speaker will be represented as speaking in ordinary fashion,
    and if the translation is not always entirely valid, it is at least the best that can be done under
    the circumstances.

    It will be pretended therefore, that the First Speaker did actually say, "First, I must tell you why
    you are here," instead of smiling just so and lifting a finger exactly thus.

    The First Speaker said, "You have studied mental science hard and well for most of your life.
    You have absorbed all your teachers could give you. It is time for you and a few others like
    yourself to begin your apprenticeship for Speakerhood."

    Agitation from the other side of the desk.



    "No - now you must take this phlegmatically. You had hoped you would qualify. You had feared
    you would not. Actually, both hope and fear are weaknesses. You knew you would qualify and
    you hesitate to admit the fact because such knowledge might stamp you as cocksure and
    therefore unfit. Nonsense! The most hopelessly stupid man is he who is not aware that he is
    wise. It is part of your qualification that you knew you would qualify."

    Relaxation on the other side of the desk.

    "Exactly. Now you feel better and your guard is down. You are fitter to concentrate and fitter to
    understand. Remember, to be truly effective, it is not necessary to hold the mind under a tight,
    controlling barrier which to the intelligent probe is as informative as a naked mentality. Rather,
    one should cultivate an innocence, an awareness of self, and an unself-consciousness of self
    which leaves one nothing to hide. My mind is open to you. Let this be so for both of us."

    He went on. "It is not an easy thing to be a Speaker. It is not an easy thing to be a
    Psychohistorian in the first place; and not even the best Psychohistorian need necessarily
    qualify to be a Speaker. There is a distinction here. A Speaker must not only be aware of the
    mathematical intricacies of the Seldon Plan; he must have a sympathy for it and for its ends. He
    must love the Plan; to him it must be life and breath. More than that it must even be as a living
    friend.

    "Do you know what this is?"

    The First Speaker's hand hovered gently over the black, shining cube in the middle of the desk.
    It was featureless.

    "No, Speaker, I do not."

    "You have heard of the Prime Radiant?"

    "This?" -Astonishment.

    "You expected something more noble and awe-inspiring? Well, that is natural. It was created in
    the days of the Empire, by men of Seldon's time. For nearly four hundred years, it has served
    our needs perfectly, without requiring repairs or adjustment. And fortunately so, since none of
    the Second Foundation is qualified to handle it in any technical fashion." He smiled gently.
    "Those of the First Foundation might be able to duplicate this, but they must never know, of
    course."

    He depressed a lever on his side of the desk and the room was in darkness. But only for a
    moment, since with a gradually livening flush, the two long walls of the room glowed to life.

    First, a pearly white, unrelieved, then a trace of faint darkness here and there, and finally, the
    fine neatly printed equations in black, with an occasional red hairline that wavered through the
    darker forest like a staggering rillet.

    "Come, my boy, step here before the wall. You will not cast a shadow. This light does not
    radiate from the Radiant in an ordinary manner. To tell you the truth, I do not know even faintly
    by what medium this effect is produced, but you will not cast a shadow. I know that."

    They stood together in the light. Each wall was thirty feet long, and ten high. The writing was



    small and covered every inch.

    "This is not the whole Plan," said the First Speaker. "To get it all upon both walls, the individual
    equations would have to be reduced to microscopic size - but that is not necessary. What you
    now see represents the main portions of the Plan till now. You have learned about this, have
    you not?"

    "Yes, Speaker, I have."

    "Do you recognize any portion."

    A slow silence. The student pointed a finger and as he did so, the line of equations marched
    down the wall, until the single series of functions he had thought of - one could scarcely
    consider the quick, generalized gesture of the finger to have been sufficiently precise - was at
    eye-level.

    The First Speaker laughed softly, "You will find the Prime Radiant to be attuned to your mind.
    You may expect more surprises from the little gadget. What were you about to say about the
    equation you have chosen?"

    "It," faltered the Student, "is a Rigellian integral, using a planetary distribution of a bias
    indicating the presence of two chief economic classes on the planet, or maybe a Sector, plus
    an unstable emotional pattern."

    "And what does it signify?"

    "It represents the limit of tension, since we have here" - he pointed, and again the equations
    veered - "a converging series."

    "Good," said the First Speaker. "And tell me, what do you think of all this. A finished work of art,
    is it not?"

    "Definitely!"

    "Wrong! It is not." This, with sharpness. "It is the first lesson you must unlearn. The Seldon Plan
    is neither complete nor correct. Instead, it is merely the best that could be done at the time.
    Over a dozen generations of men have pored over these equations, worked at them, taken
    them apart to the last decimal place, and put them together again. They've done more than
    that. They've watched nearly four hundred years pass and against the predictions and
    equations, they've checked reality, and they have learned.

    "They have learned more than Seldon ever knew, and if with the accumulated knowledge of the
    centuries we could repeat Seldon's work, we could do a better job. Is that perfectly clear to
    you?"

    The Student appeared a little shocked.

    "Before you obtain your Speakerhood," continued the First Speaker, "you yourself will have to
    make an original contribution to the Plan. It is not such great blasphemy. Every red mark you
    see on the wall is the contribution of a man among us who lived since Seldon. Why ... why-" Fie
    looked upward, "There!"



    The whole wall seemed to whirl down upon him.

    "This," he said, "is mine." A fine red line encircled two forking arrows and included six square
    feet of deductions along each path. Between the two were a series of equations in red.

    "It does not," said the Speaker, "seem to be much. It is at a point in the Plan which we will not
    reach yet for a time as long as that which has already passed. It is at the period of
    coalescence, when the Second Empire that is to be is in the grip of rival personalities who will
    threaten to pull it apart if the fight is too even, or clamp it into rigidity, if the fight is too uneven.
    Both possibilities are considered here, followed, and the method of avoiding either indicated.

    "Yet it is all a matter of probabilities and a third course can exist. It is one of comparatively low
    likelihood - twelve point six four percent, to be exact - but even smaller chances have already
    come to pass and the Plan is only forty percent complete. This third probability consists of a
    possible compromise between two or more of the conflicting personalities being considered.
    This, I showed, would first freeze the Second Empire into an unprofitable mold, and then,
    eventually, inflict more damage through civil wars than would have taken place had a
    compromise never been made in the first place. Fortunately, that could be prevented, too. And
    that was my contribution."

    "If I may interrupt, Speaker- How is a change made?"

    "Through the agency of the Radiant. You will find in your own case, for instance, that your
    mathematics will be checked rigorously by five different boards; and that you will be required to
    defend it against a concerted and merciless attack. Two years will then pass, and your
    development will be reviewed again. It has happened more than once that a seemingly perfect
    piece of work has uncovered its fallacies only after an induction period of months or years.
    Sometimes, the contributor himself discovers the flaw.

    "If, after two years, another examination, not less detailed than the first, still passes it, and -
    better still - if in the interim the young scientist has brought to light additional details, subsidiary
    evidence, the contribution will be added to the Plan. It was the climax of my career; it will be the
    climax of yours.

    "The Prime Radiant can be adjusted to your mind, and all corrections and additions can be
    made through mental rapport. There will be nothing to indicate that the correction or addition is
    yours. In all the history of the Plan there has been no personalization. It is rather a creation of
    all of us together. Do you understand?"

    "Yes, Speaker!"

    "Then, enough of that." A stride to the Prime Radiant, and the walls were blank again save for
    the ordinary room-lighting region along the upper borders. "Sit down here at my desk, and let
    me talk to you. It is enough for a Psychohistorian, as such, to know his Biostatistics and his
    Neurochemical Electromathematics. Some know nothing else and are fit only to be statistical
    technicians. But a Speaker must be able to discuss the Plan without mathematics. If not the
    Plan itself, at least its philosophy and its aims.

    "First of all, what is the aim of the Plan? Please tell me in your own words - and don't grope for



    fine sentiment. You won't be judged on polish and suavity, I assure you."

    It was the Student's first chance at more than a bisyllable, and he hesitated before plunging into
    the expectant space cleared away for him. He said, diffidently: "As a result of what I have
    learned, I believe that it is the intention of the Plan to establish a human civilization based on an
    orientation entirely different from anything that ever before existed. An orientation which,
    according to the findings of Psychohistory, could never spontaneously come into being-"

    "Stop!" The First Speaker was insistent. 'You must not say 'never.' That is a lazy slurring over of
    the facts. Actually, Psychohistory predicts only probabilities. A particular event may be
    infinitesimally probable, but the probability is always greater than zero."

    "Yes, Speaker. The orientation desired, if I may correct myself, then, is well known to possess
    no significant probability of spontaneously coming to pass."

    "Better. What is the orientation?"

    "It is that of a civilization based on mental science. In all the known history of Mankind,
    advances have been made primarily in physical technology; in the capacity of handling the
    inanimate world about Man. Control of self and society has been left to chance or to the vague
    gropings of intuitive ethical systems based on inspiration and emotion. As a result, no culture of
    greater stability than about fifty-five percent has ever existed, and these only as the result of
    great human misery."

    "And why is the orientation we speak of a nonspontaneous one?"

    "Because a large minority of human beings are mentally equipped to take part in the advance
    of physical science, and all receive the crude and visible benefits thereof. Only an insignificant
    minority, however, are inherently able to lead Man through the greater involvements of Mental
    Science; and the benefits derived therefrom, while longer lasting, are more subtle and less
    apparent. Furthermore, since such an orientation would lead to the development of a
    benevolent dictatorship of the mentally best - virtually a higher subdivision of Man - it would be
    resented and could not be stable without the application of a force which would depress the
    rest of Mankind to brute level. Such a development is repugnant to us and must be avoided."

    "What, then, is the solution?"

    "The solution is the Seldon Plan. Conditions have been so arranged and so maintained that in a
    millennium from its beginnings - six hundred years from now, a Second Galactic Empire will
    have been established in which Mankind will be ready for the leadership of Mental Science. In
    that same interval, the Second Foundation in its development, will have brought forth a group of
    Psychologists ready to assume leadership. Or, as I have myself often thought, the First
    Foundation supplies the physical framework of a single political unit, and the Second
    Foundation supplies the mental framework of a ready-made ruling class."

    "I see. Fairly adequate. Do you think that any Second Empire, even if formed in the time set by
    Seldon, would do as a fulfillment of his Plan?"

    "No, Speaker, I do not. There are several possible Second Empires that may be formed in the
    period of time stretching from nine hundred to seventeen hundred years after the inception of



    the Plan, but only one of these is the Second Empire."

    "And in view of all this, why is it necessary that the existence of the Second Foundation be
    hidden - above all, from the First Foundation?"

    The Student probed for a hidden meaning to the question and failed to find it. Fie was troubled
    in his answer, "For the same reason that the details of the Plan as a whole must be hidden from
    Mankind in general. The laws of Psychohistory are statistical in nature and are rendered invalid
    if the actions of individual men are not random in nature. If a sizable group of human beings
    learned of key details of the Plan, their actions would be governed by that knowledge and
    would no longer be random in the meaning of the axioms of Psychohistory. In other words, they
    would no longer be perfectly predictable. Your pardon, Speaker, but I feel that the answer is not
    satisfactory."

    "It is well that you do. Your answer is quite incomplete. It is the Second Foundation itself which
    must be hidden, not simply the Plan. The Second Empire is not yet formed. We have still a
    society which would resent a ruling class of psychologists, and which would fear its
    development and fight against it. Do you understand that?"

    "Yes, Speaker, I do. The point has never been stressed-"

    "Don't minimize. It has never been made - in the classroom, though you should be capable of
    deducing it yourself. This and many other points we will make now and in the near future during
    your apprenticeship. You will see me again in a week. By that time, I would like to have
    comments from you as to a certain problem which I now set before you. I don't want complete
    and rigorous mathematical treatment. That would take a year for an expert, and not a week for
    you. But I do want an indication as to trends and directions

    "You have here a fork in the Plan at a period in time of about half a century ago. The necessary
    details are included. You will note that the path followed by the assumed reality diverges from
    all the plotted predictions; its probability being under one percent. You will estimate for how
    long the divergence may continue before it becomes uncorrectable. Estimate also the probable
    end if uncorrected, and a reasonable method of correction."

    The Student flipped the Viewer at random and looked stonily at the passages presented on the
    tiny, built-in screen.

    Fie said: "Why this particular problem, Speaker? It obviously has significance other than purely
    academic."

    "Thank you, my boy. You are as quick as I had expected. The problem is not supposititious.
    Nearly half a century ago, the Mule burst into Galactic history and for ten years was the largest
    single fact in the universe. Fie was unprovided for; uncalculated for. Fie bent the Plan seriously,
    but not fatally.

    "To stop him before he did become fatal, however, we were forced to take active part against
    him. We revealed our existence, and infinitely worse, a portion of our power. The First
    Foundation has learned of us, and their actions are now predicated on that knowledge.

    Observe in the problem presented. Here. And here.



    "Naturally, you will not speak of this to anyone."

    There was an appalled pause, as realization seeped into the Student. He said: "Then the
    Seldon Plan has failed!"

    "Not yet. It merely may have failed. The probabilities of success are still twenty-one point four
    percent, as of the last assessment."


    9

    The Conspirators

    For Dr. Darell and Pelleas Anthor, the evenings passed in friendly intercourse; the days in
    pleasant unimportance. It might have been an ordinary visit. Dr. Darell introduced the young
    man as a cousin from across space, and interest was dulled by the cliche.

    Somehow, however, among the small talk, a name might be mentioned. There would be an
    easy thoughtfulness. Dr. Darell might say, "No," or he might say, "Yes." A call on the open
    Communi-wave issued a casual invitation, "Want you to meet my cousin."

    And Arcadia's preparations proceeded in their own manner. In fact, her actions might be
    considered the least straightforward of all.

    For instance, she induced Olynthus Dam at school to donate to her a home-built, self-contained
    sound-receiver by methods which indicated a future for her that promised peril to all males with
    whom she might come into contact. To avoid details, she merely exhibited such an interest in
    Olynthus' self-publicized hobby - he had a home workshop-combined with such a
    well-modulated transfer of this interest to Olynthus' own pudgy features, that the unfortunate
    youth found himself: 1 ) discoursing at great and animated length upon the principles of the
    hyperwave motor; 2) becoming dizzyingly aware of the great, absorbed eyes that rested so
    lightly upon his; and 3) forcing into her willing hands his own greatest creation, the aforesaid
    sound-receiver.

    Arcadia cultivated Olynthus in diminishing degree thereafter for just long enough to remove all
    suspicion that the sound-receiver had been the cause of the friendship. For months afterwards,
    Olynthus felt the memory of that short period in his life over and over again with the tendrils of
    his mind, until finally, for lack of further addition, he gave up and let it slip away.

    When the seventh evening came, and five men sat in the Darell living room with food within and
    tobacco without, Arcadia's desk upstairs was occupied by this quite unrecognizable
    home-product of Olynthus' ingenuity.

    Five men then. Dr. Darell, of course, with graying hair and meticulous clothing, looking
    somewhat older than his forty-two years. Pelleas Author, serious and quick-eyed at the moment
    looking young and unsure of himself. And the three new men: Jole Turbor, visicastor, bulky and
    plump-lipped; Dr. Elvett Semic, professor-emeritus of physics at the University, scrawny and
    wrinkled, his clothes only half-filled; Homir Munn, librarian, lanky and terribly ill-at-ease.



    Dr. Darell spoke easily, in a normal, matter-of-fact tone: "This gathering has been arranged,
    gentlemen, for a trifle more than merely social reasons. You may have guessed this. Since you
    have been deliberately chosen because of your backgrounds, you may also guess the danger
    involved. I won't minimize it, but I will point out that we are all condemned men, in any case.

    "You will notice that none of you have been invited with any attempt at secrecy. None of you
    have been asked to come here unseen. The windows are not adjusted to non-insight. No
    screen of any sort is about the room. We have only to attract the attention of the enemy to be
    ruined; and the best way to attract that attention is to assume a false and theatrical secrecy.

    (Hah, thought Arcadia, bending over the voices coming - a bit screechily - out of the little box.)

    "Do you understand that?"

    Elvett Semic twitched his lower lip and bared his teeth in the screwup, wrinkled gesture that
    preceded his every sentence. "Oh, get on with it. Tell us about the youngster."

    Dr. Darell said, "Pelleas Anthor is his name. He was a student of my old colleague, Kleise, who
    died last year. Kleise sent me his brain-pattern to the fifth sublevel, before he died, which
    pattern has been now checked against that of the man before you. You know, of course, that a
    brain-pattern cannot be duplicated that far, even by men of the Science of Psychology. If you
    don't know that, you'll have to take my word for it."

    Turbor said, purse-lipped, "We might as well make a beginning somewheres. We'll take your
    word for it, especially since you're the greatest electroneurologist in the Galaxy now that Kleise
    is dead. At least, that is the way I've described you in my visicast comment, and I even believe
    it myself. How old are you, Anthor?"

    "Twenty-nine, Mr. Turbor."

    "Hm-m-m. And are you an electroneurologist, too? A great one?"

    "Just a student of the science. But I work hard, and I've had the benefit of Kleise's training."

    Munn broke in. He had a slight stammer at periods of tension. "I ... I wish you'd g ... get started.
    I think everyone's t ... talking too much."

    Dr. Darell lifted an eyebrow in Munn's direction, you're right, Homir. Take over, Pelleas."

    "Not for a while," said Pelleas Anthor, slowly, "because before we can get started - although I
    appreciate Mr. Munn's sentiment - I must request brain-wave data."

    Darell frowned. "What is this, Anthor? What brain-wave data do you refer to?"

    "The patterns of all of you. You have taken mine, Dr. Darell. I must take yours and those of the
    rest of you. And I must take the measurements myself."

    Turbor said, "There's no reason for him to trust us, Darell. The young man is within his rights."

    "Thank you," said Anthor. "If you’ll lead the way to your laboratory then, Dr. Darell, well
    proceed. I took the liberty this morning of checking your apparatus."



    The science of electroencephalography was at once new and old. It was old in the sense that
    the knowledge of the microcurrents generated by nerve cells of living beings belonged to that
    immense category of human knowledge whose origin was completely lost It was knowledge
    that stretched back as far as the earliest remnants of human history—

    And yet it was new, too. The fact of the existence of microcurrents slumbered through the tens
    of thousands of years of Galactic Empire as one of those vivid and whimsical, but quite
    useless, items of human knowledge. Some had attempted to form classifications of waves into
    waking and sleeping, calm and excited, well and ill - but even the broadest conceptions had
    had their hordes of vitiating exceptions.

    Others had tried to show the existence of brain-wave groups, analogous to the well-known
    blood groups, and to show that external environment was the defining factor. These were the
    race-minded people who claimed that Man could be divided into subspecies. But such a
    philosophy could make no headway against the overwhelming ecumenical drive involved in the
    fact of Galactic Empire - one political unit covering twenty million stellar systems, involving all
    of Man from the central world of Trantor - now a gorgeous and impossible memory of the great
    past - to the loneliest asteroid on the periphery.

    And then again, in a society given over, as that of the First Empire was, to the physical
    sciences and inanimate technology, there was a vague but mighty sociological push away from
    the study of the mind. It was less respectable because less immediately useful; and it was
    poorly financed since it was less profitable.

    After the disintegration of the First Empire, there came the fragmentation of organized science,
    back, back - past even the fundamentals of atomic power into the chemical power of coal and
    oil. The one exception to this, of course, was the First Foundation where the spark of science,
    revitalized and grown more intense was maintained and fed to flame. Yet there, too, it was the
    physical that ruled, and the brain, except for surgery, was neglected ground.

    Hari Seldon was the first to express what afterwards came to be accepted as truth.

    "Neural microcurrents," he once said, "carry within them the spark of every varying impulse and
    response, conscious and unconscious. The brain-waves recorded on neatly squared paper in
    trembling peaks and troughs are the mirrors of the combined thought-pulses of billions of cells.
    Theoretically, analysis should reveal the thoughts and emotions of the subject, to the last and
    least. Differences should be detected that are due not only to gross physical defects, inherited
    or acquired, but also to shifting states of emotion, to advancing education and experience, even
    to something as subtle as a change in the subject's philosophy of life."

    But even Seldon could approach no further than speculation.

    And now for fifty years, the men of the First Foundation had been tearing at that incredibly vast
    and complicated storehouse of new knowledge. The approach, naturally, was made through
    new techniques - as, for example, the use of electrodes at skull sutures by a newly-developed
    means which enabled contact to be made directly with the gray cells, without even the
    necessity of shaving a patch of skull. And then there was a recording device which
    automatically recorded the brain-wave data as an overall total, and as separate functions of six



    independent variables.

    What was most significant, perhaps, was the growing respect in which encephalography and
    the encephalographer was held. Kleise, the greatest of them, sat at scientific conventions on an
    equal basis with the physicist. Dr. Darell, though no longer active in the science, was known for
    his brilliant advances in encephalographic analysis almost as much as for the fact that he was
    the son of Bayta Darell, the great heroine of the past generation.

    And so now, Dr. Darell sat in his own chair, with the delicate touch of the feathery electrodes
    scarcely hinting at pressure upon his skull, while the vacuum-incased needles wavered to and
    fro. His back was to the recorder - otherwise, as was well known, the sight of the moving
    curves induced an unconscious effort to control them, with noticeable results - but he knew that
    the central dial was expressing the strongly rhythmic and little-varying Sigma curve, which was
    to be expected of his own powerful and disciplined mind. It would be strengthened and purified
    in the subsidiary dial dealing with the Cerebellar wave. There would be the sharp,
    near-discontinuous leaps from the frontal lobe, and the subdued shakiness from the subsurface
    regions with its narrow range of frequencies-

    He knew his own brain-wave pattern much as an artist might be perfectly aware of the color of
    his eyes.

    Pelleas Anthor made no comment when Darell rose from the reclining chair. The young man
    abstracted the seven recordings, glanced at them with the quick, all-embracing eyes of one
    who knows exactly what tiny facet of near-nothingness is being looked for.

    "If you don't mind, Dr. Semic."

    Semic's age-yellowed face was serious. Electroencephalography was a science of his old age
    of which he knew little; an upstart that he faintly resented. He knew that he was old and that his
    wave-pattern would show it. The wrinkles on his face showed it, the stoop in his walk, the
    shaking of his hand - but they spoke only of his body. The brain-wave patterns might show that
    his mind was old, too. An embarrassing and unwarranted invasion of a man's last protecting
    stronghold, his own mind.

    The electrodes were adjusted. The process did not hurt, of course, from beginning to end.

    There was just that tiny tingle, far below the threshold of sensation.

    And then came Turbor, who sat quietly and unemotionally through the fifteen minute process,
    and Munn, who jerked at the first touch of the electrodes and then spent the session rolling his
    eyes as though he wished he could turn them backwards and watch through a hole in his
    occiput.

    "And now-" said Darell, when all was done.

    "And now," said Anthor, apologetically, "there is one more person in the house."

    Darell, frowning, said: "My daughter?"

    'Yes. I suggested that she stay home tonight, if you'll remember."



    "For encephalographical analysis? What in the Galaxy for?"

    "I cannot proceed without it."

    Darell shrugged and climbed the stairs. Arcadia, amply warned, had the sound-receiver off
    when he entered; then followed him down with mild obedience. It was the first time in her life -
    except for the taking of her basic mind pattern as an infant, for identification and registration
    purposes - that she found herself under the electrodes.

    "May I see," she asked, when it was over, holding out her hand.

    Dr. Darell said, "You would not understand, Arcadia. Isn't it time for you to go to bed?"

    "Yes, father," she said, demurely. "Good night, all."

    She ran up the stairs and plumped into bed with a minimum of basic preparation. With
    Olynthus' sound-receiver propped beside her pillow, she felt like a character out of a book-film,
    and hugged every moment of it close to her chest in an ecstasy of "Spy-stuff."

    The first words she heard were Anthor's and they were: "The analyses, gentlemen, are all
    satisfactory. The child's as well."

    Child, she thought disgustedly, and bristled at Anthor in the darkness.

    Anthor had opened his briefcase now, and out of it, he took several dozen brain-wave records.
    They were not originals. Nor had the briefcase been fitted with an ordinary lock. Had the key
    been held in any hand other than his own, the contents thereof would have silently and instantly
    oxidized to an indecipherable ash. Once removed from the briefcase, the records did so
    anyway after half an hour.

    But during their short lifetime, Anthor spoke quickly. "I have the records here of several minor
    government officials at Anacreon. This is a psychologist at Locris University; this an industrialist
    at Siwenna. The rest are as you see."

    They crowded closely. To all but Darell, they were so many quivers on parchment. To Darell,
    they shouted with a million tongues.

    Anthor pointed lightly, "I call your attention, Dr. Darell, to the plateau region among the
    secondary Tauian waves in the frontal lobe, which is what all these records have in common.
    Would you use my Analytical Rule, sir, to check my statement?"

    The Analytical Rule might be considered a distant relation - as a skyscraper is to a shack - of
    that kindergarten toy, the logarithmic Slide Rule. Darell used it with the wristflip of long practice.
    He made freehand drawings of the result and, as Anthor stated, there were featureless
    plateaus in frontal lobe regions where strong swings should have been expected.

    "How would you interpret that, Dr. Darell?" asked Anthor.

    "I'm not sure. Offhand, I don't see how it's possible. Even in cases of amnesia, there is
    suppression, but not removal. Drastic brain surgery, perhaps?"

    "Oh, something's been cut out," cried Anthor, impatiently, "yes! Not in the physical sense,



    however. You know, the Mule could have done just that. He could have suppressed completely
    all capacity for a certain emotion or attitude of mind, and leave nothing but just such a flatness.
    Or else-"

    "Or else the Second Foundation could have done it. Is that it?" asked Turbor, with a slow smile.
    There was no real need to answer that thoroughly rhetorical question.

    "What made you suspicious, Mr. Anthor?" asked Munn.

    "It wasn't I. It was Dr. Kleise. He collected brain-wave patterns much as the Planetary Police
    do, but along different lines. He specialized in intellectuals, government officials and business
    leaders. You see, it's quite obvious that if the Second Foundation is directing the historical
    course of the Galaxy - of us - that they must do it subtly and in as minimal a fashion as
    possible. If they work through minds, as they must, it is the minds of people with influence;
    culturally, industrially, or politically. And with those he concerned himself."

    "Yes," objected Munn, "but is there corroboration? How do these people act - I mean the ones
    with the plateau. Maybe it's all a perfectly normal phenomenon." He looked hopelessly at the
    others out of his, somehow, childlike blue eyes, but met no encouraging return.

    "I leave that to Dr. Darell," said Anthor. "Ask him how many times he's seen this phenomenon
    in his general studies, or in reported cases in the literature over the past generation. Then ask
    him the chances of it being discovered in almost one out of every thousand cases among the
    categories Dr. Kleise studied."

    "I suppose that there is no doubt," said Darell, thoughtfully, "that these are artificial mentalities.
    They have been tampered with. In a way, I have suspected this-"

    "I know that, Dr. Darell," said Author. "I also know you once worked with Dr. Kleise. I would like
    to know why you stopped."

    There wasn't actually hostility in his question. Perhaps nothing more than caution; but, at any
    rate, it resulted in a long pause. Darell looked from one to another of his guests, then said
    brusquely, "Because there was no point to Kleise's battle. He was competing with an adversary
    too strong for him. He was detecting what we - he and I - knew he would detect - that we were
    not our own masters. And I didn't want to know! I had my self-respect. I liked to think that our
    Foundation was captain of its collective soul; that our forefathers had not quite fought and died
    for nothing. I thought it would be most simple to turn my face away as long as I was not quite
    sure. I didn't need my position since the Government pension awarded to my mother's family in
    perpetuity would take care of my uncomplicated needs. My home laboratory would suffice to
    keep boredom away, and life would some day end- Then Kleise died-"

    Semic showed his teeth and said: "This fellow Kleise; I don't know him. How did he die?"

    Anthor cut in: "He died. He thought he would. He told me half a year before that he was getting
    too close-"

    "Now we're too c ... close, too, aren't we?" suggested Munn, dry-mouthed, as his Adam's apple
    jiggled.



    "Yes," said Anthor, flatly, "but we were, anyway - all of us. It's why you've all been chosen. I'm
    Kleise's student. Dr. Darell was his colleague. Jole Turbor has been denouncing our blind faith
    in the saving hand of the Second Foundation on the air, until the government shut him off -
    through the agency, I might mention, of a powerful financier whose brain shows what Kleise
    used to call the Tamper Plateau. Homir Munn has the largest home collection of Muliana - if I
    may use the phrase to signify collected data concerning the Mule - in existence, and has
    published some papers containing speculation on the nature and function of the Second
    Foundation. Dr. Semic has contributed as much as anyone to the mathematics of
    encephalographic analysis, though I don't believe he realized that his mathematics could be so
    applied."

    Semic opened his eyes wide and chuckled gaspingly, "No, young fellow. I was analyzing
    intranuclear motions - the n-body problem, you know. I'm lost in encephalography."

    "Then we know where we stand. The government can, of course, do nothing about the matter.
    Whether the mayor or anyone in his administration is aware of the seriousness of the situation,

    I don't know. But this I do know - we five have nothing to lose and stand to gain much. With
    every increase in our knowledge, we can widen ourselves in safe directions. We are but a
    beginning, you understand."

    "Flow widespread," put in Turbor, "is this Second Foundation infiltration?"

    "I don't know. There's a flat answer. All the infiltrations we have discovered were on the outer
    fringes of the nation. The capital world may yet be clean, though even that is not certain - else I
    would not have tested you. You were particularly suspicious, Dr. Darell, since you abandoned
    research with Kleise. Kleise never forgave you, you know. I thought that perhaps the Second
    Foundation had corrupted you, but Kleise always insisted that you were a coward. You'll forgive
    me, Dr. Darell, if I explain this to make my own position clear. I, personally, think I understand
    your attitude, and, if it was cowardice, I consider it venial."

    Darell drew a breath before replying. "I ran away! Call it what you wish. I tried to maintain our
    friendship, however, yet he never wrote nor called me until the day he sent me your brainwave
    data, and that was scarcely a week before he died-"

    "If you don't mind," interrupted Flomir Munn, with a flash of nervous eloquence, "I d ... don't see
    what you think you're doing. We're a p ... poor bunch of conspirators, if we're just going to talk
    and talk and t ... talk. And I don't see what else we can do, anyway. This is v ... very childish. B
    ... brain-waves and mumbo jumbo and all that. Is there just one thing you intend to do?'

    Pelleas Author's eyes were bright, "Yes, there is. We need more information on the Second
    Foundation. It's the prime necessity. The Mule spent the first five years of his rule in just that
    quest for information and failed - or so we have all been led to believe. But then he stopped
    looking. Why? Because he failed? Or because he succeeded?"

    "M ... more talk," said Munn, bitterly. "Flow are we ever to know?"

    "If you'll listen to me- The Mule's capital was on Kalgan. Kalgan was not part of the
    Foundation's commercial sphere of influence before the Mule and it is not part of it now. Kalgan
    is ruled, at the moment, by the man, Stettin, unless there's another palace revolution by



    tomorrow. Stettin calls himself First Citizen and considers himself the successor of the Mule. If
    there is any tradition in that world, it rests with the super-humanity and greatness of the Mule -
    a tradition almost superstitious in intensity. As a result, the Mule's old palace is maintained as a
    shrine. No unauthorized person may enter; nothing within has ever been touched."

    "Well?"

    "Well, why is that so? At times like these, nothing happens without a reason. What if it is not
    superstition only that makes the Mule's palace inviolate? What if the Second Foundation has so
    arranged matters? In short what if the results of the Mule's five-year search are within-"

    "Oh, p ... poppycock."

    "Why not?" demanded Anthor. "Throughout its history the Second Foundation has hidden itself
    and interfered in Galactic affairs in minimal fashion only. I know that to us it would seem more
    logical to destroy the Palace or, at the least, to remove the data. But you must consider the
    psychology of these master psychologists. They are Seldons; they are Mules and they work by
    indirection, through the mind. They would never destroy or remove when they could achieve
    their ends by creating a state of mind. Eh?"

    No immediate answer, and Anthor continued, "And you, Munn, are just the one to get the
    information we need."

    "I?" It was an astounded yell. Munn looked from one to the other rapidly, "I can't do such a
    thing. I'm no man of action; no hero of any teleview. I'm a librarian. If I can help you that way, all
    right, and I'll risk the Second Foundation, but I'm not going out into space on any qu ... quixotic
    thing like that."

    "Now, look," said Anthor, patiently, "Dr. Darell and I have both agreed that you're the man. It's
    the only way to do it naturally. You say you're a librarian. Fine! What is your main field of
    interest? Muliana! You already have the greatest collection of material on the Mule in the
    Galaxy. It is natural for you to want more; more natural for you than for anyone else. You could
    request entrance to the Kalgan Palace without arousing suspicion of ulterior motives. You might
    be refused but you would not be suspected. What's more, you have a one-man cruiser. You're
    known to have visited foreign planets during your annual vacation. You've even been on Kalgan
    before. Don't you understand that you need only act as you always have?"

    "But I can't just say, 'W ... won't you kindly let me in to your most sacred shrine, M ... Mr. First
    Citizen?’"

    "Why not?"

    "Because, by the Galaxy, he won't let me!"

    "All right, then. So he won't Then you'll come home and we’ll think of something else."

    Munn looked about in helpless rebellion. Fie felt himself being talked into something he hated.
    No one offered to help him extricate himself.


    So in the end two decisions were made in Dr. Darell's house. The first was a reluctant one of



    agreement on the part of Munn to take off into space as soon as his summer vacation began.

    The other was a highly unauthorized decision on the part of a thoroughly unofficial member of
    the gathering, made as she clicked off a sound-receiver and composed herself for a belated
    sleep. This second decision does not concern us just yet.

    10

    Approaching Crisis

    A week had passed on the Second Foundation, and the First Speaker was smiling once again
    upon the Student.

    "You must have brought me interesting results, or you would not be so filled with anger."

    The Student put his hand upon the sheaf of calculating paper he had brought with him and
    said, "Are you sure that the problem is a factual one?"

    "The premises are true. I have distorted nothing."

    "Then I must accept the results, and I do not want to."

    "Naturally. But what have your wants to do with it? Well, tell me what disturbs you so. No, no,
    put your derivations to one side. I will subject them to analysis afterward. Meanwhile, talkto
    me. Let me judge your understanding."

    "Well, then, Speaker- It becomes very apparent that a gross overall change in the basic
    psychology of the First Foundation has taken place. As long as they knew of the existence of a
    Seldon Plan, without knowing any of the details thereof, they were confident but uncertain.
    They knew they would succeed, but they didn't know when or how. There was, therefore, a
    continuous atmosphere of tension and strain - which was what Seldon desired. The First
    Foundation, in other words, could be counted upon to work at maximum potential."

    "A doubtful metaphor," said the First Speaker, "but I understand you."

    "But now, Speaker, they know of the existence of a Second Foundation in what amounts to
    detail, rather merely than as an ancient and vague statement of Seldon's. They have an inkling
    as to its function as the guardian of the Plan. They know that an agency exists which watches
    their every step and will not let them fall. So they abandon their purposeful stride and allow
    themselves to be carried upon a litter. Another metaphor, I'm afraid."

    "Nevertheless, go on."

    "And that very abandonment of effort; that growing inertia; that lapse into softness and into a
    decadent and hedonistic culture, means the ruin of the Plan. They must be self-propelled."

    "Is that all?"

    "No, there is more. The majority reaction is as described. But a great probability exists for a



    minority reaction. Knowledge of our guardianship and our control will rouse among a few, not
    complacence, but hostility. This follows from Korillov's Theorem-"

    "Yes, yes. I know the theorem."

    "I'm sorry, Speaker. It is difficult to avoid mathematics. In any case, the effect is that not only is
    the Foundation's effort diluted, but part of it is turned against us, actively against us."

    "And is that all?"

    "There remains one other factor of which the probability is moderately low—"

    "Very good. What is that?"

    "While the energies of the First Foundation were directed only to Empire; while their only
    enemies were huge and outmoded hulks that remained from the shambles of the past, they
    were obviously concerned only with the physical sciences. With us forming a new, large part of
    their environment, a change in view may well be imposed on them. They may try to become
    psychologists-"

    "That change," said the First Speaker, coolly , " has already taken place."

    The Student's lips compressed themselves into a pale line. "Then all is over. It is the basic
    incompatibility with the Plan. Speaker, would I have known of this if I had lived - outside?"

    The First Speaker spoke seriously, "You feel humiliated, my young man, because, thinking you
    understood so much so well, you suddenly find that many very apparent things were unknown
    to you. Thinking you were one of the Lords of the Galaxy; you suddenly find that you stand near
    to destruction. Naturally, you will resent the ivory tower in which you lived; the seclusion in
    which you were educated; the theories on which you were reared.

    "I once had that feeling. It is normal. Yet it was necessary that in your formative years you have
    no direct contact with the Galaxy, that you remain here, where all knowledge is filtered to you,
    and your mind carefully sharpened. We could have shown you this ... this part-failure of the
    Plan earlier and spared you the shock now, but you would not have understood the significance
    properly, as you now will. Then you find no solution at all to the problem?"

    The Student shook his head and said hopelessly, "None!"

    "Well, it is not surprising. Listen to me, young man. A course of action exists and has been
    followed for over a decade. It is not a usual course, but one that we have been forced into
    against our will. It involves low probabilities, dangerous assumptions- We have even been
    forced to deal with individual reactions at times, because that was the only possible way, and
    you know that Psychostatistics by its very nature has no meaning when applied to less than
    planetary numbers."

    "Are we succeeding?" gasped the Student.

    "There's no way of telling yet. We have kept the situation stable so far - but for the first time in
    the history of the Plan, it is possible for the unexpected actions of a single individual to destroy
    it. We have adjusted a minimum number of outsiders to a needful state of mind; we have our



    agents - but their paths are planned. They dare not improvise. That should be obvious to you.
    And I will not conceal the worst - if we are discovered, here, on this world, it will not only be the
    Plan that is destroyed, but ourselves, our physical selves. So you see, our solution is not very
    good."

    "But the little you have described does not sound like a solution at all, but like a desperate
    guess."

    "No. Let us say, an intelligent guess."

    "When is the crisis, Speaker? When will we know whether we have succeeded or not?"

    "Well within the year, no doubt."

    The Student considered that, then nodded his head. He shook hands with the Speaker. "Well,
    it's good to know."

    He turned on his heel and left.

    The first Speaker looked out silently as the window gained transparency. Past the giant
    structures to the quite, crowding stars.

    A year would pass quickly. Would any of them, any of Seldon's heritage, be alive at its end?

    11

    Stowaway

    It was a little over a month before the summer could be said to have started. Started, that is, to
    the extent that Homir Munn had written his final financial report of the fiscal year, seen to it that
    the substitute librarian supplied by the Government was sufficiently aware of the subtleties of
    the post - last year's man had been quite unsatisfactory - and arranged to have his little cruiser
    the Unimara - named after a tender and mysterious episode of twenty years past - taken out of
    its winter cobwebbery.

    He left Terminus in a sullen distemper. No one was at the port to see him off. That would not
    have been natural since no one ever had in the past. He knew very well that it was important to
    have this trip in no way different from any he had made in the past, yet he felt drenched in a
    vague resentment. He, Homir Munn, was risking his neck in derring-doery of the most
    outrageous sort, and yet he left alone.

    At least, so he thought.

    And it was because he thought wrongly, that the following day was one of confusion, both on
    the Unimara and in Dr. Darell's suburban home.

    It hit Dr. Darell's home first, in point of time, through the medium of Poli, the maid, whose
    month's vacation was now quite a thing of the past. She flew down the stairs in a flurry and
    stutter.



    The good doctor met her and she tried vainly to put emotion into words but ended by thrusting
    a sheet of paper and a cubical object at him.

    He took them unwillingly and said: "What's wrong, Poli?"

    "She's gone, doctor."

    "Who's gone?"

    "Arcadia!"

    "What do you mean, gone? Gone where? What are you talking about?"

    And she stamped her foot: 'I don't know. She's gone, and there's a suitcase and some clothes
    gone with her and there's that letter. Why don't you read it, instead of just standing there? Oh,
    you men!"

    Dr. Darell shrugged and opened the envelope. The letter was not long, and except for the
    angular signature, "Arkady," was in the ornate and flowing handwriting of Arcadia's transcriber.

    Dear Father:

    It would have been simply too heartbreaking to say good-by to you in person. I
    might have cried like a little girl and you would have been ashamed of me. So I'm
    writing a letter instead to tell you how much III miss you, even while I'm having this
    perfectly wonderful summer vacation with Uncle Homir. Ill take good care of myself
    and it won't be long before I’m home again. Meanwhile, I'm leaving you something
    that's all my own. You can have it now.

    Your loving daughter,

    Arkady.

    He read it through several times with an expression that grew blanker each time. He said stiffly,
    "Have you read this, Poli?"

    Poli was instantly on the defensive. "I certainly can't be blamed for that, doctor. The envelope
    has 'Poli' written on the outside, and I had no way of telling there was a letter for you on the
    inside. I'm no snoop, doctor, and in the years I've been with-"

    Darell held up a placating hand, "Very well, Poli. It's not important. I just wanted to make sure
    you understood what had happened."

    He was considering rapidly. It was no use telling her to forget the matter. With regard to the
    enemy, "forget" was a meaningless word; and the advice, insofar as it made the matter more
    important, would have had an opposite effect.

    He said instead, "She's a queer little girl, you know. Very romantic. Ever since we arranged to
    have her go off on a space trip this summer, she's been quite excited."

    "And just why has no one told me about this space trip?"



    "It was arranged while you were away, and we forgot It's nothing more complicated than that."

    Poli's original emotions now concentrated themselves into a single, overwhelming indignation,
    "Simple, is it? The poor chick has gone off with one suitcase, without a decent stitch of clothes
    to her, and alone at that. How long will she be away?"

    "Now I won't have you worrying about it, Poli. There will be plenty of clothes for her on the ship.
    It's been all arranged. Will you tell Mr. Anthor, that I want to see him? Oh, and first - is this the
    object that Arcadia has left for me?" He turned it over in his hand.

    Poli tossed her head. "I'm sure I don't know. The letter was on top of it and that's every bit I can
    tell you. Forget to tell me, indeed. If her mother were alive-"

    Darell, waved her away. "Please call Mr. Anthor."

    Anthor's viewpoint on the matter differed radically from that of Arcadia's father. He punctuated
    his initial remarks with clenched fists and tom hair, and from there, passed on to bitterness.

    "Great Space, what are you waiting for? What are we both waiting for? Get the spaceport on
    the viewer and have them contact the Unimara."

    "Softly, Pelleas, she's my daughter."

    "But it's not your Galaxy."

    "Now, wait. She's an intelligent girl, Pelleas, and she's thought this thing out carefully. We had
    better follow her thoughts while this thing is fresh. Do you know what this thing is?"

    "No. Why should it matter what it is?'

    "Because it's a sound-receiver."

    "That thing?"

    "It's homemade, but it will work. I've tested it. Don't you see? It's her way of telling us that she's
    been a party to our conversations of policy. She knows where Homir Munn is going and why.
    She's decided it would be exciting to go along."

    "Oh, Great Space," groaned the younger man. "Another mind for the Second Foundation to
    pick."

    "Except that there's no reason why the Second Foundation should, a priori, suspect a
    fourteen-year-old girl of being a danger - unless we do anything to attract attention to her, such
    as calling back a ship out of space for no reason other than to take her off. Do you forget with
    whom we're dealing? How narrow the margin is that separates us from discovery? How
    helpless we are thereafter?"

    "But we can't have everything depend on an insane child."

    She's not insane, and we have no choice. She need not have written the letter, but she did it to
    keep us from going to the police after a lost child. Her letter suggests that we convert the entire
    matter into a friendly offer on the part of Munn to take an old friend's daughter off for a short



    vacation. And why not? He's been my friend for nearly twenty years. He's known her since she
    was three, when I brought her back from Trantor. It's a perfectly natural thing, and, in fact,
    ought to decrease suspicion. A spy does not carry a fourteen-year-old niece about with him."

    "So. And what will Munn do when he finds her?"

    Dr. Darell heaved his eyebrows once. "I can't say - but I presume she’ll handle him."

    But the house was somehow very lonely at night and Dr. Darell found that the fate of the
    Galaxy made remarkably little difference while his daughter's mad little life was in danger.

    The excitement on the Unimara, if involving fewer people, was considerably more intense.

    In the luggage compartment, Arcadia found herself, in the first place, aided by experience, and
    in the second, hampered by the reverse.

    Thus, she met the initial acceleration with equanimity and the more subtle nausea that
    accompanied the inside-outness of the first jump through hyperspace with stoicism. Both had
    been experienced on space hops before, and she was tensed for them. She knew also that
    luggage compartments were included in the ship's ventilation-system and that they could even
    be bathed in wall-light. This last, however, she excluded as being too unconscionably
    unromantic. She remained in the dark, as a conspirator should, breathing very softly, and
    listening to the little miscellany of noises that surrounded Homir Munn.

    They were undistinguished noises, the kind made by a man alone. The shuffling of shoes, the
    rustle of fabric against metal, the soughing of an upholstered chair seat retreating under weight,
    the sharp click of a control unit, or the soft slap of a palm over a photoelectric cell.

    Yet, eventually, it was the lack of experience that caught up with Arcadia. In the book films and
    on the videos, the stowaway seemed to have such an infinite capacity for obscurity. Of course,
    there was always the danger of dislodging something which would fall with a crash, or of
    sneezing - in videos you were almost sure to sneeze; it was an accepted matter. She knew all
    this, and was careful. There was also the realization that thirst and hunger might be
    encountered. For this, she was prepared with ration cans out of the pantry. But yet things
    remained that the films never mentioned, and it dawned upon Arcadia with a shock that,
    despite the best intentions in the world, she could stay hidden in the closet for only a limited
    time.

    And on a one-man sports-cruiser, such as the Unimara, living space consisted, essentially, of a
    single room, so that there wasn't even the risky possibility of sneaking out of the compartment
    while Munn was engaged elsewhere.

    She waited frantically for the sounds of sleep to arise. If only she knew whether he snored. At
    least she knew where the bunk was and she could recognize the rolling protest of one when
    she heard it. There was a long breath and then a yawn. She waited through a gathering
    silence, punctuated by the bunk's soft protest against a changed position or a shifted leg.

    The door of the luggage compartment opened easily at the pressure of her finger, and her
    craning neck-



    There was a definite human sound that broke off sharply.

    Arcadia solidified. Silence! Still silence!

    She tried to poke her eyes outside the door without moving her head and failed. The head
    followed the eyes.

    Homir Munn was awake, of course - reading in bed, bathed in the soft, unspreading bed light,
    staring into the darkness with wide eyes, and groping one hand stealthily under the pillow.

    Arcadia's head moved sharply back of itself. Then, the light went out entirely and Munn's voice
    said with shaky sharpness, "I've got a blaster, and I'm shooting, by the Galaxy-"

    And Arcadia wailed, "It's only me. Don't shoot."

    Remarkable what a fragile flower romance is. A gun with a nervous operator behind it can spoil
    the whole thing.

    The light was back on - all over the ship - and Munn was sitting up in bed. The somewhat
    grizzled hair on his thin chest and the sparse one-day growth on his chin lent him an entirely
    fallacious appearance of disreputability.

    Arcadia stepped out, yanking at her metallene jacket which was supposed to be guaranteed
    wrinkleproof.

    After a wild moment in which he almost jumped out of bed, but remembered, and instead
    yanked the sheet up to his shoulders, Munn gargled, "W ... wha ... what-"

    He was completely incomprehensible.

    Arcadia said meekly, "Would you excuse me for a minute? I've got to wash my hands." She
    knew the geography of the vessel, and slipped away quickly. When she returned, with her
    courage oozing back, Homir Munn was standing before her with a faded bathrobe on the
    outside and a brilliant fury on the inside.

    "What the black holes of Space are you d ... doing aboard this ship? H ... how did you get on
    here? What do you th ... think I'm supposed to do with you? What's going on here?"

    He might have asked questions indefinitely, but Arcadia interrupted sweetly, "I just wanted to
    come along, Uncle Homir."

    "Why?\'m not going anywhere?"

    "You're going to Kalgan for information about the Second Foundation."

    And Munn let out a wild howl and collapsed completely. For one horrified moment, Arcadia
    thought he would have hysterics or beat his head against the wall. He was still holding the
    blaster and her stomach grew ice-cold as she watched it.

    "Watch out-Take it easy-" was all she could think of to say.

    But he struggled back to relative normality and threw the blaster on to the bunk with a force that



    should have set it off and blown a hole through the ship's hull.

    "How did you get on?" he asked slowly, as though gripping each word with his teeth very
    carefully to prevent it from trembling before letting it out.

    "It was easy. I just came into the hangar with my suitcase, and said, 'Mr. Munn's baggage!' and
    the man in charge just waved his thumb without even looking up."

    "I'll have to take you back, you know," said Homir, and there was a sudden wild glee within him
    at the thought. By Space, this wasn't his fault.

    "You can't," said Arcadia, calmly, "it would attract attention."

    "What?"

    "You know. The whole purpose of your going to Kalgan was because it was natural for you to
    go and ask for permission to look into the Mule's records. And you've got to be so natural that
    you're to attract no attention at all. If you go back with a girl stowaway, it might even get into the
    tele-news reports."

    "Where did you g ... get those notions about Kalgan? These ... uh ... childish-" He was far too
    flippant for conviction, of course, even to one who knew less than did Arcadia.

    "I heard," she couldn't avoid pride completely, "with a sound-recorder. I know all about it - so
    you've got to let me come along."

    "What about your father?" He played a quick trump. "For all he knows, you're kidnapped ...
    dead."

    "I left a note," she said, overtrumping, "and he probably knows he mustn't make a fuss, or
    anything. You'll probably get a space-gram from him."

    To Munn the only explanation was sorcery, because the receiving signal sounded wildly two
    seconds after she finished.

    She said: "That's my father, I bet," and it was.

    The message wasn't long and it was addressed to Arcadia. It said: "Thank you for your lovely
    present, which I'm sure you put to good use. Have a good time."

    "You see," she said, "that's instructions."

    Homir grew used to her. After a while, he was glad she was there. Eventually, he wondered
    how he would have made it without her. She prattled! She was excited! Most of all, she was
    completely unconcerned. She knew the Second Foundation was the enemy, yet it didn't bother
    her. She knew that on Kalgan, he was to deal with a hostile officialdom, but she could hardly
    wait.

    Maybe it came of being fourteen.

    At any rate, the week-long trip now meant conversation rather than introspection. To be sure, it
    wasn't a very enlightening conversation, since it concerned, almost entirely, the girl's notions on



    the subject of how best to treat the Lord of Kalgan. Amusing and nonsensical, and yet delivered
    with weighty deliberation.

    Homir found himself actually capable of smiling as he listened and wondered out of just which
    gem of historical fiction she got her twisted notion of the great universe.

    It was the evening before the last jump. Kalgan was a bright star in the scarcely-twinkling
    emptiness of the outer reaches of the Galaxy. The ship's telescope made it a sparkling blob of
    barely-perceptible diameter.

    Arcadia sat cross-legged in the good chair. She was wearing a pair of slacks and a
    none-too-roomy shirt that belonged to Homir. Her own more feminine wardrobe had been
    washed and ironed for the landing.

    She said, "I'm going to write historical novels, you know." She was quite happy about the trip.
    Uncle Homir didn't the least mind listening to her and it made conversation so much more
    pleasant when you could talk to a really intelligent person who was serious about what you
    said.

    She continued: "I've read books and books about all the great men of Foundation history. You
    know, like Seldon, Hardin, Mallow, Devers and all the rest. I've even read most of what you've
    written about the Mule, except that it isn't much fun to read those parts where the Foundation
    loses. Wouldn't you rather read a history where they skipped the silly, tragic parts?"

    "Yes, I would," Munn assured her, gravely. "But it wouldn't be a fair history, would it, Arkady?
    You'd never get academic respect, unless you give the whole story."

    "Oh, poof. Who cares about academic respect?" She found him delightful. He hadn't missed
    calling her Arkady for days. "My novels are going to be interesting and are going to sell and be
    famous. What's the use of writing books unless you sell them and become well-known? I don't
    want just some old professors to know me. It's got to be everybody."

    Her eyes darkened with pleasure at the thought and she wriggled into a more comfortable
    position. "In fact, as soon as I can get father to let me, I'm going to visit Trantor, so's I can get
    background material on the First Empire, you know. I was born on Trantor; did you know that?"

    He did, but he said, "You were?" and put just the right amount of amazement into his voice. He
    was rewarded with something between a beam and a simper.

    "Uh-huh. My grandmother ... you know, Bayta Darell, you've heard of her ... was on Trantor
    once with my grandfather. In fact, that's where they stopped the Mule, when all the Galaxy was
    at his feet; and my father and mother went there also when they were first married. I was born
    there. I even lived there till mother died, only I was just three then, and I don't remember much
    about it. Were you ever on Trantor, Uncle Homir?"

    "No, can't say I was." He leaned back against the cold bulkhead and listened idly. Kalgan was
    very close, and he felt his uneasiness flooding back.

    "Isn't it just the most romantic world? My father says that under Stannel V, it had more people
    than any ten worlds nowadays. He says it was just one big world of metals - one big city - that



    was the capital of all the Galaxy. He's shown me pictures that he took on Trantor. It's all in ruins
    now, but it's still stupendous. I'd just love to see it again. In fact ... Homir!"

    "Yes?"

    "Why don't we go there, when we're finished with Kalgan?"

    Some of the fright hurtled back into his face. "What? Now don't start on that. This is business,
    not pleasure. Remember that."

    "But it is business" she squeaked. "There might be incredible amounts of information on
    Trantor, don't you think so?*

    "No, I don't He scrambled to his feet "Now untangle yourself from the computer. We've got to
    make the last jump, and then you turn in." One good thing about landing, anyway; he was about
    fed up with trying to sleep on an overcoat on the metal floor.

    The calculations were not difficult. The "Space Route Handbook" was quite explicit on the
    Foundation-Kalgan route. There was the momentary twitch of the timeless passage through
    hyperspace and the final light-year dropped away.

    The sun of Kalgan was a sun now - large, bright, and yellow-white; invisible behind the
    portholes that had automatically closed on the sun-lit side.

    Kalgan was only a night's sleep away.


    12

    Lord

    Of all the worlds of the Galaxy, Kalgan undoubtedly had the most unique history. That of the
    planet Terminus, for instance, was that of an almost uninterrupted rise. That of Trantor, once
    capital of the Galaxy, was that of an almost uninterrupted fall. But Kalgan-

    Kalgan first gained fame as the pleasure world of the Galaxy two centuries before the birth of
    Hari Seldon. It was a pleasure world in the sense that it made an industry - and an immensely
    profitable one, at that - out of amusement.

    And it was a stable industry. It was the most stable industry in the Galaxy. When all the Galaxy
    perished as a civilization, little by little, scarcely a feather's weight of catastrophe fell upon
    Kalgan. No matter how the economy and sociology of the neighboring sectors of the Galaxy
    changed, there was always an elite; and it is always the characteristic of an elite that it
    possesses leisure as the great reward of its elite-hood.

    Kalgan was at the service, therefore, successively - and successfully - of the effete and
    perfumed dandies of the Imperial Court with their sparkling and libidinous ladies; of the rough
    and raucous warlords who ruled in iron the worlds they had gained in blood, with their unbridled
    and lascivious wenches; of the plump and luxurious businessmen of the Foundation, with their
    lush and flagitious mistresses.



    It was quite undiscriminating, since they all had money. And since Kalgan serviced all and
    barred none; since its commodity was in unfailing demand; since it had the wisdom to interfere
    in no world's politics, to stand on no one's legitimacy, it prospered when nothing else did, and
    remained fat when all grew thin.

    That is, until the Mule. Then, somehow, it fell, too, before a conqueror who was impervious to
    amusement, or to anything but conquest. To him all planets were alike, even Kalgan.

    So for a decade, Kalgan found itself in the strange role of Galactic metropolis; mistress of the
    greatest Empire since the end of the Galactic Empire itself.

    And then, with the death of the Mule, as sudden as the zoom, came the drop. The Foundation
    broke away. With it and after it, much of the rest of the Mule's dominions. Fifty years later there
    was left only the bewildering memory of that short space of power, like an opium dream. Kalgan
    never quite recovered. It could never return to the unconcerned pleasure world it had been, for
    the spell of power never quite releases its bold. It lived instead under a succession of men
    whom the Foundation called the Lords of Kalgan, but who styled themselves First Citizen of the
    Galaxy, in imitation of the Mule's only title, and who maintained the fiction that they were
    conquerors too.

    The current Lord of Kalgan had held that position for five months. Fie had gained it originally by
    virtue of his position at the head of the Kalganian navy, and through a lamentable lack of
    caution on the part of the previous lord. Yet no one on Kalgan was quite stupid enough to go
    into the question of legitimacy too long or too closely. These things happened, and are best
    accepted.

    Yet that sort of survival of the fittest in addition to putting a premium on bloodiness and evil,
    occasionally allowed capability to come to the fore as well. Lord Stettin was competent enough
    and not easy to manage.

    Not easy for his eminence, the First Minister, who, with fine impartiality, had served the last lord
    as well as the present; and who would, if he lived long enough, serve the next as honestly.

    Nor easy for the Lady Callia, who was Stettin's more than friend, yet less than wife.

    In Lord Stettin's private apartments the three were alone that evening. The First Citizen, bulky
    and glistening in the admiral's uniform that he affected, scowled from out the unupholstered
    chair in which he sat as stiffly as the plastic of which it was composed. His First Minister Lev
    Meirus, faced him with a far-off unconcern, his long, nervous fingers stroking absently and
    rhythmically the deep line that curved from hooked nose along gaunt and sunken cheek to the
    point, nearly, of the gray-bearded chin. The Lady Callia disposed of herself gracefully on the
    deeply furred covering of a foamite couch, her full lips trembling a bit in an unheeded pout.

    "Sir," said Meirus - it was the only title adhering to a lord who was styled only First Citizen, "you
    lack a certain view of the continuity of history. Your own life, with its tremendous revolutions,
    leads you to think of the course of civilization as something equally amenable to sudden
    change. But it is not."


    The Mule showed otherwise.



    "But who can follow in his footsteps. He was more than man, remember. And be, too, was not
    entirely successful."

    "Poochie," whimpered the Lady Callia, suddenly, and then shrank into herself at the furious
    gesture from the First Citizen.

    Lord Stettin said, harshly, "Do not interrupt, Callia. Meirus, I am tired of inaction. My
    predecessor spent his life polishing the navy into a finely-turned instrument that has not its
    equal in the Galaxy. And he died with the magnificent machine lying idle. Am I to continue that?
    I, an Admiral of the Navy?

    "How long before the machine rusts? At present, it is a drain on the Treasury and returns
    nothing. Its officers long for dominion, its men for loot. All Kalgan desires the return of Empire
    and glory. Are you capable of understanding that?"

    "These are but words that you use, but I grasp your meaning. Dominion, loot, glory - pleasant
    when they are obtained, but the process of obtaining them is often risky and always
    unpleasant. The first fine flush may not last. And in all history, it has never been wise to attack
    the Foundation. Even the Mule would have been wiser to refrain-"

    There were tears in the Lady Callia's blue, empty eyes. Of late, Poochie scarcely saw her, and
    now, when he had promised the evening to her, this horrible, thin, gray man, who always
    looked through her rather than at her, had forced his way in. And Poochie let him. She dared
    not say anything; was frightened even of the sob that forced its way out.

    But Stettin was speaking now in the voice she hated, hard and Impatient. He was saying:
    "You're a slave to the far past. The Foundation is greater in volume and population, but they
    are loosely knit and will fall apart at a blow. What holds them together these days is merely
    inertia; an inertia I am strong enough to smash. You are hypnotized by the old days when only
    the Foundation had atomic power. They were able to dodge the last hammer blows of the dying
    Empire and then faced only the unbrained anarchy of the warlords who would counter the
    Foundation's atomic vessels only with hulks and relics.

    "But the Mule, my dear Meirus, has changed that. He spread the knowledge, that the
    Foundation had hoarded to itself, through half the Galaxy and the monopoly in science is gone
    forever. We can match them."

    "And the Second Foundation?" questioned Meirus, coolly.

    "And the Second Foundation?" repeated Stettin as coolly. "Do you know its intentions? It took
    ten years to stop the Mule, if, indeed, it was the factor, which some doubt. Are you unaware
    that a good many of the Foundation's psychologists and sociologists are of the opinion that the
    Seldon Plan has been completely disrupted since the days of the Mule? If the Plan has gone,
    then a vacuum exists which I may fill as well as the next man."

    "Our knowledge of these matters is not great enough to warrant the gamble."

    "Our knowledge, perhaps, but we have a Foundation visitor on the planet. Did you know that? A
    Homir Munn - who, I understand, has written articles on the Mule, and has expressed exactly



    that opinion, that the Seldon Plan no longer exists."

    The First Minister nodded, "I have heard of him, or at least of his writings. What does he
    desire?"

    "He asks permission to enter the Mule's palace."

    "Indeed? It would be wise to refuse. It is never advisable to disturb the superstitions with which
    a planet is held."

    "I will consider that - and we will speak again."

    Meirus bowed himself out.

    Lady Callia said tearfully, "Are you angry with me, Poochie?" Stettin turned on her savagely.
    "Have I not told you before never to call me by that ridiculous name in the presence of others?"

    "You used to like it."

    "Well, I don't any more, and it is not to happen again."

    He stared at her darkly. It was a mystery to him that he tolerated her these days. She was a
    soft, empty-headed thing, comfortable to the touch, with a pliable affection that was a
    convenient facet to a hard life. Yet, even that affection was becoming wearisome. She dreamed
    of marriage, of being First Lady.

    Ridiculous!

    She was all very well when he had been an admiral only - but now as First Citizen and future
    conqueror, he needed more. He needed heirs who could unite his future dominions, something
    the Mule had never had, which was why his Empire did not survive his strange nonhuman life.
    He, Stettin, needed someone of the great historic families of the Foundation with whom he
    could fuse dynasties.

    He wondered testily why he did not rid himself of Callia now. It would be no trouble. She would
    whine a bit- He dismissed the thought. She had her points, occasionally.

    Callia was cheering up now. The influence of Graybeard was gone and her Poochie's granite
    face was softening now. She lifted herself in a single, fluid motion and melted toward him.

    "You're not going to scold me, are you?"

    "No." He patted her absently. "Now just sit quietly for a while, will you? I want to think."

    "About the man from the Foundation?"

    "Yes."

    "Poochie?" This was a pause.

    "What?"

    "Poochie, the man has a little girl with him, you said. Remember? Could I see her when she



    comes? I never-'


    "Now what do you think I want him to bring his brat with him for? Is my audience room to be a
    grammar school? Enough of your nonsense, Callia."

    "But I’ll take care of her, Poochie. You won't even have to bother with her. It's just that I hardly
    ever see children, and you know how I love them."

    He looked at her sardonically. She never tired of this approach. She loved children; i.e. his
    children; i.e. his legitimate children; i.e. marriage. He laughed.

    "This particular little piece," he said, "is a great girl of fourteen or fifteen. She's probably as tall
    as you are."

    Callia looked crushed. "Well, could I, anyway? She could tell me about the Foundation? I've
    always wanted to go there, you know. My grandfather was a Foundation man. Won't you take
    me there, sometime, Poochie?"

    Stettin smiled at the thought. Perhaps he would, as conqueror. The good nature that the
    thought supplied him with made itself felt in his words, "I will, I will. And you can see the girl and
    talk Foundation to her all you want. But not near me, understand."

    "I won't bother you, honestly. I'll have her in my own rooms." She was happy again. It was not
    very often these days that she was allowed to have her way. She put her arms about his neck
    and after the slightest hesitation, she felt its tendons relax and the large head come softly down
    upon her shoulder.


    13

    Lady

    Arcadia felt triumphant. How life had changed since Pelleas Anthor had stuck his silly face up
    against her window - and all because she had the vision and courage to do what needed to be
    done.

    Here she was on Kalgan. She had been to the great Central Theater - the largest in the Galaxy
    - and seen in person some of the singing stars who were famous even in the distant
    Foundation. She had shopped all on her own along the Flowered Path, fashion center of the
    gayest world in Space. And she had made her own selections because Homir just didn't know
    anything about it at all. The saleswomen raised no objections at all to long, shiny dresses with
    those vertical sweeps that made her look so tall - and Foundation money went a long, long
    way. Homir had given her a ten-credit bill and when she changed it to Kalganian "Kalganids," it
    made a terribly thick sheaf.

    She had even had her hair redone - sort of half-short in back, with two glistening curls over
    each temple. And it was treated so that it looked goldier than ever; it just shone.

    But this, this was best of all. To be sure, the Palace of Lord Stettin wasn't as grand and lavish



    as the theaters, or as mysterious and historical as the old palace of the Mule - of which, so far
    they had only glimpsed the lonely towers in their air flight across the planet - but, imagine, a
    real Lord. She was rapt in the glory of it.

    And not only that. She was actually face to face with his Mistress. Arcadia capitalized the word
    in her mind, because she knew the role such women had played in history; knew their glamour
    and power. In fact, she had often thought of being an all-powerful and glittering creature,
    herself, but somehow mistresses weren't in fashion at the Foundation just then and besides,
    her father probably wouldn't let her, if it came to that.

    Of course, the Lady Callia didn't quite come up to Arcadia's notion of the part. For one thing,
    she was rather plump, and didn't look at all wicked and dangerous, just sort of faded and
    near-sighted. Her voice was high, too, instead of throaty, and-

    Callia said, "Would you like more tea, child?"

    "I'll have another cup, thank you, your grace," - or was it your highness?

    Arcadia continued with a connoisseur's condescension, "Those are lovely pearls you are
    wearing, my lady." (On the whole, "my lady" seemed best.)

    "Oh? Do you think so?" Callia seemed vaguely pleased. She removed them and let them swing
    milkily to and fro. "Would you like them? You can have them, if you like."

    "Oh, my- You really mean-" She found them in her hand, then, repelling them mournfully, she
    said, "Father wouldn't like it."

    "Fie wouldn't like the pearls? But they're quite nice pearls."

    "Fie wouldn't like my taking them, I mean. You're not supposed to take expensive presents from
    other people, he says."

    "You aren't? But ... I mean, this was a present to me from Poo ... from the First Citizen. Was
    that wrong, do you suppose?"

    Arcadia reddened. "I didn't mean-"

    But Callia had tired of the subject. She let the pearls slide to the ground and said, "You were
    going to tell me about the Foundation. Please do so right now."

    And Arcadia was suddenly at a loss. What does one say about a world dull to tears. To her, the
    Foundation was a suburban town, a comfortable house, the annoying necessities of education,
    the uninteresting eternities of a quiet life. She said, uncertainly, "It's just like you view in the
    book-films, I suppose."

    "Oh, do you view book-films? They give me such a headache when I try. But do you know I
    always love video stories about your Traders - such big, savage men. It's always so exciting. Is
    your friend, Mr. Munn, one of them? Fie doesn't seem nearly savage enough. Most of the
    Traders had beards and big bass voices, and were so domineering with women - don't you
    think so?"



    Arcadia smiled, glassily. "That's just part of history, my lady. I mean, when the Foundation was
    Young, the Traders were the pioneers pushing back the frontiers and bringing civilization to the
    rest of the Galaxy. We learned all about that in school. But that time has passed. We don't have
    Traders any more; just corporations and things."

    "Really? What a shame. Then what does Mr. Munn do? I mean, if he's not a Trader."

    "Uncle Homir's a librarian."

    Callia put a hand to her lips and tittered. "You mean he takes care of book-films. Oh, my! It
    seems like such a silly thing for a grown man to do."

    "He's a very good librarian, my lady. It is an occupation that is very highly regarded at the
    Foundation." She put down the little, iridescent teacup upon the milky-metaled table surface.

    Her hostess was all concern. "But my dear child. I'm sure I didn't mean to offend you. He must
    be a very intelligent man. I could see it in his eyes as soon as I looked at him. They were so ...
    so intelligent. And he must be brave, too, to want to see the Mule's palace."

    "Brave?" Arcadia's internal awareness twitched. This was what she was waiting for. Intrigue!
    Intrigue! With great indifference, she asked, staring idly at her thumbtip: "Why must one be
    brave to wish to see the Mule's palace?"

    "Didn't you know?" Her eyes were round, and her voice sank. "There's a curse on it. When he
    died, the Mule directed that no one ever enter it until the Empire of the Galaxy is established.
    Nobody on Kalgan would dare even to enter the grounds."

    Arcadia absorbed that. "But that's superstition-"

    "Don't say that," Callia was distressed. "Poochie always says that. He says it's useful to say it
    isn't though, in order to maintain his hold over the people. But I notice he's never gone in
    himself. And neither did Thallos, who was First Citizen before Poochie." A thought struck her
    and she was all curiosity again: "But why does Mr. Munn want to see the Palace?"

    And it was here that Arcadia's careful plan could be put into action. She knew well from the
    books she had read that a ruler's mistress was the real power behind the throne, that she was
    the very well-spring of influence. Therefore, if Uncle Homir failed with Lord Stettin - and she
    was sure he would - she must retrieve that failure with Lady Callia. To be sure, Lady Callia was
    something of a puzzle. She didn't seem at all bright. But, well, all history proved-

    She said, "There's a reason, my lady - but will you keep it in confidence?"

    "Cross my heart," said Callia, making the appropriate gesture on the soft, billowing whiteness of
    her breast.

    Arcadia's thoughts kept a sentence ahead of her words. "Uncle Homir is a great authority on
    the Mule, you know. He's written books and books about it, and he thinks that all of Galactic
    history has been changed since the Mule conquered the Foundation."

    "Oh, my."



    He thinks the Seldon Plan-'


    Callia clapped her hands. "I know about the Seldon Plan. The videos about the Traders were
    always all about the Seldon Plan. It was supposed to arrange to have the Foundation win all
    the time. Science had something to do with it, though I could never quite see how. I always get
    so restless when I have to listen to explanations. But you go right ahead, my dear. It's different
    when you explain. You make everything seem so clear."

    Arcadia continued, "Well, don't you see then that when the Foundation was defeated by the
    Mule, the Seldon Plan didn't work and it hasn't worked since. So who will form the Second
    Empire?"

    "The Second Empire?"

    "Yes, one must be formed some day, but how? That's the problem, you see. And there's the
    Second Foundation."

    "The Second Foundation?" She was quite completely lost.

    'Yes, they're the planners of history that are following in the footsteps of Seldon. They stopped
    the Mule because he was premature, but now, they may be supporting Kalgan."

    "Why?"

    "Because Kalgan may now offer the best chance of being the nucleus for a new Empire."

    Dimly, Lady Callia seemed to grasp that. "You mean Poochie is going to make a new Empire."

    "We can't tell for sure. Uncle Homir thinks so, but hell have to see the Mule's records to find
    out."

    "It's all very complicated," said Lady Callia, doubtfully.

    Arcadia gave up. She had done her best.

    Lord Stettin was in a more-or-less savage humor. The session with the milksop from the
    Foundation had been quite unrewarding. It had been worse; it had been embarrassing. To be
    absolute ruler of twenty-seven worlds, master of the Galaxy's greatest military machine, owner
    of the universe's most vaulting ambition - and left to argue nonsense with an antiquarian.

    Damnation!

    He was to violate the customs of Kalgan, was he? To allow the Mule's palace to be ransacked
    so that a fool could write another book? The cause of science! The sacredness of knowledge!
    Great Galaxy! Were these catchwords to be thrown in his face in all seriousness? Besides -
    and his flesh prickled slightly - there was the matter of the curse. He didn't believe in it; no
    intelligent man could. But if he was going to defy it, it would have to be for a better reason than
    any the fool had advanced.

    "What do you want?" he snapped, and Lady Callia cringed visibly in the doorway.

    "Are you busy?"



    "Yes. I am busy."

    "But there's nobody here, Poochie. Couldn't I even speak to you for a minute?"

    "Oh, Galaxy! What do you want? Now hurry."

    Her words stumbled. "The little girl told me they were going into the Mule's palace. I thought we
    could go with her. It must be gorgeous inside."

    "She told you that, did she? Well, she isn't and we aren't. Now go tend your own business. I've
    had about enough of you."

    "But, Poochie, why not? Aren't you going to let them? The little girl said that you were going to
    make an Empire!"

    "I don't care what she said- What was that?" He strode to Callia, and caught her firmly above
    the elbow, so that his fingers sank deeply into the soft flesh, "What did she tell you?"

    "You're hurting me. I can't remember what she said, if you're going to look at me like that."

    He released her, and she stood there for a moment, rubbing vainly at the red marks. She
    whimpered, "The little girl made me promise not to tell."

    "That's too bad. Tell me! Now!"

    "Well, she said the Seldon Plan was changed and that there was another Foundation
    somewheres that was arranging to have you make an Empire. That's all. She said Mr. Munn
    was a very important scientist and that the Mule's palace would have proof of all that. That's
    every bit of what she said. Are you angry?"

    But Stettin did not answer. He left the room, hurriedly, with Callia's cowlike eyes staring
    mournfully after him. Two orders were sent out over the official seal of the First Citizen before
    the hour was up. One had the effect of sending five hundred ships of the line into space on
    what were officially to be termed as "war games." The other had the effect of throwing a single
    man into confusion.

    Homir Munn ceased his preparations to leave when that second order reached him. It was, of
    course, official permission to enter the palace of the Mule. He read and reread it with anything
    but joy.

    But Arcadia was delighted. She knew what had happened.

    Or, at any rate, she thought she did.


    14



    Anxiety

    Poli placed the breakfast on the table, keeping one eye on the table news-recorder which
    quietly disgorged the bulletins of the day. It could be done easily enough without loss of
    efficiency, this one-eye-absent business. Since all items of food were sterilely packed in
    containers which served as discardable cooking units, her duties vis-a-vis breakfast consisted
    of nothing more than choosing the menu, placing the items on the table, and removing the
    residue thereafter.

    She clacked her tongue at what she saw and moaned softly in retrospect.

    "Oh, people are so wicked," she said, and Darell merely hemmed in reply.

    Her voice took on the high-pitched rasp which she automatically assumed when about to bewail
    the evil of the world. "Now why do these terrible Kalganese" - she accented the second
    syllable and gave it a long "a" - "do like that? You'd think they'd give a body peace. But no, it's
    just trouble, trouble, all the time.

    "Now look at that headline: 'Mobs Riot Before Foundation Consulate.’ Oh, would I like to give
    them a piece of my mind, if I could. That's the trouble with people; they just don't remember.
    They just don't remember, Dr. Darell - got no memory at all. Look at the last war after the Mule
    died - of course I was just a little girl then - and oh, the fuss and trouble. My own uncle was
    killed, him being just in his twenties and only two years married, with a baby girl. I remember
    him even yet - blond hair he had, and a dimple in his chin. I have a trimensional cube of him
    somewheres-

    "And now his baby girl has a son of her own in the navy and most like if anything happens-

    "And we had the bombardment patrols, and all the old men taking turns in the stratospheric
    defense - I could imagine what they would have been able to do if the Kalganese had come
    that far. My mother used to tell us children about the food rationing and the prices and taxes. A
    body could hardly make ends meet-

    "You'd think if they had sense people would just never want to start it again; just have nothing
    to do with it. And I suppose it's not people that do it, either; I suppose even Kalganese would
    rather sit at home with their families and not go fooling around in ships and getting killed. It's
    that awful man, Stettin. It's a wonder people like that are let live. He kills the old man - what's
    his name - Thallos, and now he's just spoiling to be boss of everything.

    "And why he wants to fight us, I don't know. He's bound to lose - like they always do. Maybe it's
    all in the Plan, but sometimes I'm sure it must be a wicked plan to have so much fighting and
    killing in it, though to be sure I haven't a word to say about Hari Seldon, who I'm sure knows
    much more about that than I do and perhaps I'm a fool to question him. And the other
    Foundation is as much to blame. They could stop Kalgan now and make everything fine. They'll
    do it anyway in the end, and you'd think they'd do it before there's any damage done."

    Dr. Darell looked up. "Did you say something, Poli?"

    Poli's eyes opened wide, then narrowed angrily. "Nothing, doctor, nothing at all. I haven't got a



    word to say. A body could as soon choke to death as say a word in this house. It's jump here,
    and jump there, but just try to say a word-" and she went off simmering.

    Her leaving made as little impression on Darell as did her speaking.

    Kalgan! Nonsense! A merely physical enemy! Those had always been beaten!

    Yet he could not divorce himself of the current foolish crisis. Seven days earlier, the mayor had
    asked him to be Administrator of Research and Development. He had promised an answer
    today.

    Well-

    He stirred uneasily. Why, himself! Yet could he refuse? It would seem strange, and he dared
    not seem strange. After all, what did he care about Kalgan. To him there was only one enemy.
    Always had been.

    While his wife had lived, he was only too glad to shirk the task; to hide. Those long, quiet days
    on Trantor, with the ruins of the past about them! The silence of a wrecked world and the
    forgetfulness of it all!

    But she had died. Less than five years, all told, it had been; and after that he knew that he
    could live only by fighting that vague and fearful enemy that deprived him of the dignity of
    manhood by controlling his destiny; that made life a miserable struggle against a foreordained
    end; that made all the universe a hateful and deadly chess game.

    Call it sublimation; he, himself did can it that - but the fight gave meaning to his life.

    First to the University of Santanni, where he had joined Dr. Kleise. It had been five years
    well-spent.

    And yet Kleise was merely a gatherer of data. He could not succeed in the real task - and
    when Darell had felt that as certainty, he knew it was time to leave.

    Kleise may have worked in secret, yet he had to have men working for him and with him. He
    had subjects whose brains he probed. He had a University that backed him. All these were
    weaknesses.

    Kleise could not understand that; and he, Darell, could not explain that. They parted enemies. It
    was well; they had to. He had to leave in surrender - in case someone watched.

    Where Kleise worked with charts; Darell worked with mathematical concepts in the recesses of
    his mind. Kleise worked with many; Darell with none. Kleise in a University; Darell in the quiet
    of a suburban house.

    And he was almost there.

    A Second Foundationer is not human as far as his cerebrum is concerned. The cleverest
    physiologist, the most subtle neurochemist might detect nothing - yet the difference must be
    there.



    And since the difference was one of the mind, it was there that it must be detectable.


    Given a man like the Mule - and there was no doubt that the Second Foundationers had the
    Mule's powers, whether inborn or acquired - with the power of detecting and controlling human
    emotions, deduce from that the electronic circuit required, and deduce from that the last details
    of the encephalograph on which it could not help but be betrayed.

    And now Kleise had returned into his life, in the person of his ardent young pupil, Anthor.

    Folly! Folly! With his graphs and charts of people who had been tampered with. Fie had learned
    to detect that years ago, but of what use was it. Fie wanted the arm; not the tool. Yet he had to
    agree to join Anthor, since it was the quieter course.

    Just as now he would become Administrator of Research and Development. It was the quieter
    course! And so he remained a conspiracy within a conspiracy.

    The thought of Arcadia teased him for a moment, and he shuddered away from it. Left to
    himself, it would never have happened. Left to himself, no one would ever have been
    endangered but himself. Left to himself-

    Fle felt the anger rising-against the dead Kleise, the living Anthor, all the well-meaning fools-
    Well, she could take care of herself. She was a very mature little girl.

    She could take care of herself!

    It was a whisper in his mind-
    Yet could she?

    At the moment, that Dr. Darell told himself mournfully that she could, she was sitting in the
    coldly austere anteroom of the Executive Offices of the First Citizen of the Galaxy. For half an
    hour she had been sitting there, her eyes sliding slowly about the walls. There had been two
    armed guards at the door when she had entered with Flomir Munn. They hadn't been there the
    other times.

    She was alone, now, yet she sensed the unfriendliness of the very furnishings of the room. And
    for the first time.

    Now, why should that be?

    Flomir was with Lord Stettin. Well, was that wrong?

    It made her furious. In similar situations in the book-films and the videos, the hero foresaw the
    conclusion, was prepared for it when it came, and she - she just sat there. Anything could
    happen. Anything! And she just sat there.

    Well, back again. Think it back. Maybe something would come.

    For two weeks, Flomir had nearly lived inside the Mule's palace. Fie had taken her once, with
    Stettin's permission. It was large and gloomily massive, shrinking from the touch of life to lie
    sleeping within its ringing memories, answering the footsteps with a hollow boom or a savage



    clatter. She hadn't liked it.


    Better the great, gay highways of the capital city; the theaters and spectacles of a world
    essentially poorer than the Foundation, yet spending more of its wealth on display.

    Homir would return in the evening, awed-

    "It's a dream-world for me," he would whisper. "If I could only chip the palace down stone by
    stone, layer by layer of the aluminum sponge. If I could carry it back to Terminus- What a
    museum it would make."

    He seemed to have lost that early reluctance. He was eager, instead; glowing. Arcadia knew
    that by the one sure sign; he practically never stuttered throughout that period.

    One time, he said, "There are abstracts of the records of General Pritcher-"

    "I know him. He was the Foundation renegade, who combed the Galaxy for the Second
    Foundation, wasn't he?"

    "Not exactly a renegade, Arkady. The Mule had Converted him."

    "Oh, it's the same thing."

    "Galaxy, that combing you speak of was a hopeless task. The original records of the Seldon
    Convention that established both Foundations five hundred years ago, make only one
    reference to the Second Foundation. They say if's located 'at the other end of the Galaxy at
    Star's End.' That's all the Mule and Pritcher had to go on. They had no method of recognizing
    the Second Foundation even if they found it. What madness!

    "They have records" - he was speaking to himself, but Arcadia listened eagerly - "which must
    cover nearly a thousand worlds, yet the number of worlds available for study must have been
    closer to a million. And we are no better off-"

    Arcadia broke in anxiously, "Shhh-h" \n a tight hiss.

    Homir froze, and slowly recovered. "Let's not talk," he mumbled.

    And now Homir was with Lord Stettin and Arcadia waited outside alone and felt the blood
    squeezing out of her heart for no reason at all. That was more frightening than anything else.
    That there seemed no reason.

    On the other side of the door, Homir, too, was living in a sea of gelatin. He was fighting, with
    furious intensity, to keep from stuttering and, of course, could scarcely speak two consecutive
    words clearly as a result.

    Lord Stettin was in full uniform, six-feet-six, large-jawed, and hard-mouthed. His balled,
    arrogant fists kept a powerful time to his sentences.

    "Well, you have had two weeks, and you come to me with tales of nothing. Come, sir, tell me
    the worst. Is my Navy to be cut to ribbons? Am I to fight the ghosts of the Second Foundation
    as well as the men of the First?"



    "I ... I repeat, my lord, I am no p ... pre ... predictor. I ... I am at a complete ... loss."

    "Or do you wish to go back to warn your countrymen? To deep Space with your play-acting. I
    want the truth or I’ll have it out of you along with half your guts."

    "I'm t ... telling only the truth, and I'll have you re ... remember, my I ... lord, that I am a citizen of
    the Foundation. Y ... you cannot touch me without harvesting m ... m ... more than you count
    on."

    The Lord of Kalgan laughed uproariously. "A threat to frighten children. A horror with which to
    beat back an idiot. Come, Mr. Munn, I have been patient with you. I have listened to you for
    twenty minutes while you detailed wearisome nonsense to me which must have cost you
    sleepless nights to compose. It was wasted effort. I know you are here not merely to rake
    through the Mule's dead ashes and to warm over the cinders you findyou come here for more
    than you have admitted. Is that not true?"

    Homir Munn could no more have quenched the burning horror that grew in his eyes than, at
    that moment, he could have breathed. Lord Stettin saw that, and clapped the Foundation man
    upon his shoulder so that he and the chair he sat on reeled under the impact.

    "Good. Now let us be frank. You are investigating the Seldon Plan. You know that it no longer
    holds. You know, perhaps, that I am the inevitable winner now; I and my heirs. Well, man, what
    matters it who established the Second Empire, so long as it is established. History plays no
    favorites, eh? Are you afraid to tell me? You see that I know your mission."

    Munn said thickly, "What is it y ... you w ... want?"

    "Your presence. I would not wish the Plan spoiled through overconfidence. You understand
    more of these things than I do; you can detect small flaws that I might miss. Come, you will be
    rewarded in the end; you will have your fair glut of the loot. What can you expect at the
    Foundation? To turn the tide of a perhaps inevitable defeat? To lengthen the war? Or is it
    merely a patriotic desire to die for your country?"

    "I ... I-" He finally spluttered into silence. Not a word would come.

    "You will stay," said the Lord of Kalgan, confidently. "You have no choice. Wait" - an almost
    forgotten afterthought - "I have information to the effect that your niece is of the family of Bayta
    Darell."

    Homir uttered a startled: "Yes." He could not trust himself at this point to be capable of weaving
    anything but cold truth.

    "It is a family of note on the Foundation?"

    Homir nodded, "To whom they would certainly b ... brook no harm."

    "Harm! Don't be a fool, man; I am meditating the reverse. How old is she?"

    "Fourteen."

    "Sol Well, not even the Second Foundation, or Hari Seldon, himself, could stop time from



    passing or girls from becoming women."

    With that, he turned on his heel and strode to a draped door which he threw open violently.

    He thundered, "What in Space have you dragged your shivering carcass here for?"

    The Lady Callia blinked at him, and said in a small voice, "I didn't know anyone was with you."
    "Well, there is. I'll speak to you later of this, but now I want to see your back, and quickly."

    Her footsteps were a fading scurry in the corridor.

    Stettin returned, "She is a remnant of an interlude that has lasted too long. It will end soon.
    Fourteen, you say?"

    Homir stared at him with a brand-new horror!

    Arcadia started at the noiseless opening of a door - jumping at the jangling sliver of movement
    it made in the comer of her eye. The finger that crooked frantically at her met no response for
    long moments, and then, as if in response to the cautions enforced by the very sight of that
    white, trembling figure, she tiptoed her way across the floor.

    Their footsteps were a taut whisper in the corridor. It was the Lady Callia, of course, who held
    her hand so tightly that it hurt, and for some reason, she did not mind following her. Of the Lady
    Callia, at least, she was not afraid.

    Now, why was that?

    They were in a boudoir now, all pink fluff and spun sugar. Lady Callia stood with her back
    against the door.

    She said, "This was our private way to me ... to my room, you know, from his office. His, you
    know." And she pointed with a thumb, as though even the thought of him were grinding her soul
    to death with fear.

    "It's so lucky ... it’s so lucky-" Her pupils had blackened out the blue with their size.

    "Can you tell me-" began Arcadia timidly.

    And Callia was in frantic motion. "No, child, no. There is no time. Take off your clothes. Please.
    Please. I'll get you more, and they won't recognize you."

    She was in the closet, throwing useless bits of flummery in reckless heaps upon the ground,
    looking madly for something a girl could wear without becoming a living invitation to dalliance.

    "Here, this will do. It will have to. Do you have money? Here, take it all - and this." She was
    stripping her ears and fingers. "Just go home - go home to your Foundation."

    "But Homir ... my uncle." She protested vainly through the muffling folds of the sweet-smelling
    and luxurious spun-metal being forced over her head.

    "He won't leave. Poochie will hold him forever, but you mustn't stay. Oh, dear, don't you
    understand?"



    No." Arcadia forced a standstill, "I don't understand.


    Lady Callia squeezed her hands tightly together. "You must go back to warn your people there
    will be war. Isn't that clear?" Absolute terror seemed paradoxically to have lent a lucidity to her
    thoughts and words that was entirely out of character. "Now come!"

    Out another way! Past officials who stared after them, but saw no reason to stop one whom
    only the Lord of Kalgan could stop with impunity. Guards clicked heels and presented arms
    when they went through doors.

    Arcadia breathed only on occasion through the years the trip seemed to take - yet from the first
    crooking of the white finger to the time she stood at the outer gate, with people and noise and
    traffic in the distance was only twenty-five minutes.

    She looked back, with a sudden frightened pity. "I ... I ... don't know why you're doing this, my
    lady, but thanks- What's going to happen to Uncle Homir?"

    "I don't know," wailed the other. "Can't you leave? Go straight to the spaceport. Don't wait. He
    may be looking for you this very minute."

    And still Arcadia lingered. She would be leaving Homir; and, belatedly, now that she felt the
    free air about her, she was suspicious. "But what do you care if he does?"

    Lady Callia bit her lower lip and muttered, "I can't explain to a little girl like you. It would be
    improper. Well, you'll be growing up and I ... I met Poochie when I was sixteen. I can't have you
    about, you know." There was a half-ashamed hostility in her eyes.

    The implications froze Arcadia. She whispered: "What will he do to you when he finds out?"

    And she whimpered back: "I don't know," and threw her arm to her head as she left at a
    half-run, back along the wide way to the mansion of the Lord of Kalgan.

    But for one eternal second, Arcadia sf/7/ did not move, for in that last moment before Lady Callia
    left, Arcadia had seen something. Those frightened, frantic eyes had momentarily - flashingly -
    lit up with a cold amusement.

    Avast, inhuman amusement.

    It was much to see in such a quick flicker of a pair of eyes, but Arcadia had no doubt of what
    she saw.

    She was running now - running wildly - searching madly for an unoccupied public booth at
    which one could press a button for public conveyance.

    She was not running from Lord Stettin; not from him or from all the human hounds he could
    place at her heels - not from all his twenty-seven worlds rolled into a single gigantic
    phenomenon, hallooing at her shadow.

    She was running from a single, frail woman who had helped her escape. From a creature who
    had loaded her with money and jewels; who had risked her own life to save her. From an entity
    she knew, certainly and finally, to be a woman of the Second Foundation.



    An air-taxi came to a soft clicking halt in the cradle. The wind of its coming brushed against
    Arcadia's face and stirred at the hair beneath the softly-furred hood Callia had given her.

    "Where'll it be, lady?"

    She fought desperately to low-pitch her voice to make it not that of a child. "How many
    spaceports in the city?"

    "Two. Which one ya want?"

    "Which is closer?"

    He stared at her: "Kalgan Central, lady."

    "The other one, please. I’ve got the money." She had a twenty-Kalganid note in her hand. The
    denomination of the note made little difference to her, but the taxi-man grinned appreciatively.

    "Anything ya say, lady. Sky-line cabs take ya anywhere."

    She cooled her cheek against the slightly musty upholstery. The lights of the city moved
    leisurely below her.

    What should she do? What should she do?

    It was in that moment that she knew she was a stupid , stupid little girl, away from her father,
    and frightened. Her eyes were full of tears, and deep down in her throat, there was a small,
    soundless cry that hurt her insides.

    She wasn't afraid that Lord Stettin would catch her. Lady Callia would see to that. Lady Callia!
    Old, fat, stupid, but she held on to her lord, somehow. Oh, it was clear enough, now. Everything
    was clear.

    That tea with Callia at which she had been so smart. Clever little Arcadia! Something inside
    Arcadia choked and hated itself. That tea had been maneuvered, and then Stettin had probably
    been maneuvered so that Homir was allowed to inspect the Palace after all. She, the foolish
    Callia, has wanted it so, and arranged to have smart little Arcadia supply a foolproof excuse,
    one which would arouse no suspicions in the minds of the victims, and yet involve a minimum
    of interference on her part.

    Then why was she free? Homir was a prisoner, of course-
    Unless-

    Unless she went back to the Foundation as a decoy - a decoy to lead others into the hands of
    ...of them.

    So she couldn't return to the Foundation-

    "Spaceport, lady." The air-taxi had come to a halt. Strange! She hadn't even noticed.

    What a dream-world it was.



    "Thanks," she pushed the bill at him without seeing anything and was stumbling out the door,
    then running across the springy pavement.

    Lights. Unconcerned men and women. Large gleaming bulletin boards, with the moving figures
    that followed every single spaceship that arrived and departed.

    Where was she going? She didn't care. She only knew that she wasn't going to the Foundation!
    Anywhere else at all would suit.

    Oh, thank Seldon, for that forgetful moment - that last split-second when Callia wearied of her
    act because she had to do only with a child and had let her amusement spring through.

    And then something else occurred to Arcadia, something that had been stirring and moving at
    the base of her brain ever since the flight began - something that forever killed the fourteen in
    her.

    And she knew that she must escape.

    That above all. Though they located every conspirator on the Foundation; though they caught
    her own father; she could not dared not, risk a warning. She could not risk her own life - not in
    the slightest - for the entire realm of Terminus. She was the most important person in the
    Galaxy. She was the only important person in the Galaxy.

    She knew that even as she stood before the ticket-machine and wondered where to go.

    Because in all the Galaxy, she and she alone, except for they, themselves, knew the location of
    the Second Foundation.

    Through the Grid

    TRANTOR By the middle of the Interregnum, Trantor was a shadow. In the midst of the
    colossal ruins, there lived a small community of farmers....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    There is nothing, never has been anything, quite like a busy spaceport on the outskirts of a
    capital city of a populous planet. There are the huge machines resting mightily in their cradles.
    If you choose your time properly, there is the impressive sight of the sinking giant dropping to
    rest or, more hair-raising still, the swiftening departure of a bubble of steel. All processes
    involved are nearly noiseless. The motive power is the silent surge of nucleons shifting into
    more compact arrangements

    In terms of area, ninety-five percent of the port has just been referred to. Square miles are
    reserved for the machines, and for the men who serve them and for the calculators that serve
    both.


    Only five percent of the port is given over to the floods of humanity to whom it is the way station



    to all the stars of the Galaxy. It is certain that very few of the anonymous many-headed stop to
    consider the technological mesh that knits the spaceways. Perhaps some of them might itch
    occasionally at the thought of the thousands of tons represented by the sinking steel that looks
    so small off in the distance. One of those cyclopean cylinders could, conceivably, miss the
    guiding beam and crash half a mile from its expected landing point - through the glassite roof
    of the immense waiting room perhaps - so that only a thin organic vapor and some powdered
    phosphates would be left behind to mark the passing of a thousand men.

    It could never happen, however, with the safety devices in use; and only the badly neurotic
    would consider the possibility for more than a moment.

    Then what do they think about? It is not just a crowd, you see. It is a crowd with a purpose.

    That purpose hovers over the field and thickens the atmosphere. Lines queue up; parents herd
    their children; baggage is maneuvered in precise masses - people are going somewheres.

    Consider then the complete psychic isolation of a single unit of this terribly intent mob that does
    not know where to go; yet at the same time feels more intensely than any of the others possibly
    can, the necessity of going somewheres; anywhere! Or almost anywhere!

    Even lacking telepathy or any of the crudely definite methods of mind touching mind, there is a
    sufficient clash in atmosphere, in intangible mood, to suffice for despair.

    To suffice? To overflow, and drench, and drown.

    Arcadia Darell, dressed in borrowed clothes, standing on a borrowed planet in a borrowed
    situation of what seemed even to be a borrowed life, wanted earnestly the safety of the womb.
    She didn't know that was what she wanted. She only knew that the very openness of the open
    world was a great danger. She wanted a closed spot somewhere - somewhere far -
    somewhere in an unexplored nook of the universe - where no one would ever look.

    And there she was, age fourteen plus, weary enough for eighty plus, frightened enough for five
    minus.

    What stranger of the hundreds that brushed past her - actually brushed past her, so that she
    could feel their touch - was a Second Foundationer? What stranger could not help but instantly
    destroy her for her guilty knowledge - her unique knowledge - of knowing where the Second
    Foundation was?

    And the voice that cut in on her was a thunderclap that iced the scream in her throat into a
    voiceless slash.

    "Look, miss," it said, irritably, "are you using the ticket machine or are you just standing there?"

    It was the first she realized that she was standing in front of a ticket machine. You put a high
    denomination bill into the clipper which sank out of sight. You pressed the button below your
    destination and a ticket came out together with the correct change as determined by an
    electronic scanning device that never made a mistake. It was a very ordinary thing and there is
    no cause for anyone to stand before it for five minutes.

    Arcadia plunged a two-hundred credit into the clipper, and was suddenly aware of the button



    labeled "Trantor." Trantor, dead capital of the dead Empire - the planet on which she was born.
    She pressed it in a dream. Nothing happened, except that the red letters flicked on and off,
    reading 172.18- 172.18— 172.18—

    It was the amount she was short. Another two-hundred credit. The ticket was spit out towards
    her. It came loose when she touched it, and the change tumbled out afterward.

    She seized it and ran. She felt the man behind her pressing close, anxious for his own chance
    at the machine, but she twisted out from before him and did not look behind.

    Yet there was nowhere to run. They were all her enemies.

    Without quite realizing it, she was watching the gigantic, glowing signs that puffed into the air:
    Steffani, Anacreon, Fermus- There was even one that ballooned, Terminus, and she longed for
    it, but did not dare-

    For a trifling sum, she could have hired a notifier which could have been set for any destination
    she cared and which would, when placed in her purse, make itself heard only to her, fifteen
    minutes before take-off time. But such devices are for people who are reasonably secure,
    however; who can pause to think of them.

    And then, attempting to look both ways simultaneously, she ran head-on into a soft abdomen.
    She felt the startled outbreath and grunt, and a hand come down on her arm. She writhed
    desperately but lacked breath to do more than mew a bit in the back of her throat.

    Her captor held her firmly and waited. Slowly, he came into focus for her and she managed to
    look at him. He was rather plump and rather short. His hair was white and copious, being
    brushed back to give a pompadour effect that looked strangely incongruous above a round and
    ruddy face that shrieked its peasant origin.

    "What's the matter?" he said finally, with a frank and twinkling curiosity. "You look scared."
    "Sorry," muttered Arcadia in a frenzy. "I’ve got to go. Pardon me."

    But he disregarded that entirely, and said, "Watch out, little girl. You'll drop your ticket." And he
    lifted it from her resistless white fingers and looked at it with every evidence of satisfaction.

    "I thought so," he said, and then bawled in bull-like tones, "Mommuh!"

    A woman was instantly at his side, somewhat more short, somewhat more round, somewhat
    more ruddy. She wound a finger about a stray gray lock to shove it beneath a well-outmoded
    hat.

    "Pappa," she said, reprovingly, "why do you shout in a crowd like that? People look at you like
    you were crazy. Do you think you are on the farm?"

    And she smiled sunnily at the unresponsive Arcadia, and added, "He has manners like a bear."
    Then, sharply, "Pappa, let go the little girl. What are you doing?"

    But Pappa simply waved the ticket at her. "Look," he said, "she's going to Trantor."



    Mamma's face was a sudden beam, "You're from Trantor? Let go her arm, I say, Pappa." She
    turned the overstuffed valise she was carrying onto its side and forced Arcadia to sit down with
    a gentle but unrelenting pressure. "Sit down," she said, "and rest your little feet. It will be no
    ship yet for an hour and the benches are crowded with sleeping loafers. You are from Trantor?"

    Arcadia drew a deep breath and gave in. Huskily, she said, "I was born there."

    And Mamma clapped her hands gleefully, "One month we've been here and till now we met
    nobody from home. This is very nice. Your parents-" she looked about vaguely.

    "I'm not with my parents," Arcadia said, carefully.

    "All alone? A little girl like you?" Mamma was at once a blend of indignation and sympathy,
    "How does that come to be?"

    "Mamma," Pappa plucked at her sleeve, "let me tell you. There's something wrong. I think she's
    frightened." His voice, though obviously intended for a whisper was quite plainly audible to
    Arcadia. "She was running - I was watching her - and not looking where she was going. Before
    I could step out of the way, she bumped into me. And you know what? I think she's in trouble."

    "So shut your mouth, Pappa. Into you, anybody could bump." But she joined Arcadia on the
    valise, which creaked wearily under the added weight and put an arm about the girl's trembling
    shoulder. "You're running away from somebody, sweetheart? Don't be afraid to tell me. Ill help
    you."

    Arcadia looked across at the kind gray eyes of the woman and felt her lips quivering. One part
    of her brain was telling her that here were people from Trantor, with whom she could go, who
    could help her remain on that planet until she could decide what next to do, where next to go.
    And another part of her brain, much the louder, was telling her in jumbled incoherence that she
    did not remember her mother, that she was weary to death of fighting the universe, that she
    wanted only to curl into a little hall with strong, gentle arms about her, that if her mother had
    lived, she might ... she might-

    And for the first time that night, she was crying; crying like a little baby, and glad of it; clutching
    tightly at the old-fashioned dress and dampening a corner of it thoroughly, while soft arms held
    her closely and a gentle hand stroked her curls.

    Pappa stood helplessly looking at the pair, fumbling futilely for a handkerchief which, when
    produced, was snatched from his hand. Mamma glared an admonition of quietness at him. The
    crowds surged about the little group with the true indifference of disconnected crowds
    everywhere. They were effectively alone.

    Finally, the weeping trickled to a halt, and Arcadia smiled weakly as she dabbed at red eyes
    with the borrowed handkerchief. "Golly," she whispered,

    "S/7/7. S/7/7. Don't talk," said Mamma, fussily, "just sit and rest for a while. Catch your breath.
    Then tell us what's wrong, and you'll see, we'll fix it up, and everything will be all right."

    Arcadia scrabbled what remained of her wits together. She could not tell them the truth. She
    could tell nobody the truth- And yet she was too worn to invent a useful lie.



    She said, whisperingly, "I'm better, now."

    "Good," said Mamma. "Now tell me why you’re in trouble. You did nothing wrong? Of course,
    whatever you did, well help you; but tell us the truth."

    "For a friend from Trantor, anything," added Pappa, expansively, "eh, Mamma?"

    "Shut your mouth, Pappa," was the response, without rancor.

    Arcadia was groping in her purse. That, at least, was still hers, despite the rapid
    clothes-changing forced upon her in Lady Callia's apartments. She found what she was looking
    for and handed it to Mamma.

    "These are my papers," she said, diffidently. It was shiny, synthetic parchment which had been
    issued her by the Foundation's ambassador on the day of her arrival and which had been
    countersigned by the appropriate Kalganian official. It was large, florid, and impressive.

    Mamma looked at it helplessly, and passed it to Pappa who absorbed its contents with an
    impressive pursing of the lips.

    Fie said, "You're from the Foundation?"

    "Yes. But I was born in Trantor. See it says that-"

    "Ah-hah. It looks all right to me. You're named Arcadia, eh? That's a good Trantorian name. But
    where's your uncle? It says here you came in the company of Homir Munn, uncle."

    "He's been arrested," said Arcadia, drearily.

    "Arrested!" - from the two of them at once. "What for?" asked Mamma. "He did something?"

    She shook her head. "I don't know. We were just on a visit. Uncle Homir had business with
    Lord Stettin but-" She needed no effort to act a shudder. It was there.

    Pappa was impressed. "With Lord Stettin. Mm-m-m, your uncle must be a big man."

    "I don't know what it was all about, but Lord Stettin wanted me to stay-" She was recalling the
    last words of Lady Callia, which had been acted out for her benefit. Since Callia, as she now
    knew, was an expert, the story could do for a second time.

    She paused, and Mamma said interestedly, "And why you?"

    "I'm not sure. He ... he wanted to have dinner with me all alone, but I said no, because I wanted
    Uncle Homir along. He looked at me funny and kept holding my shoulder."

    Pappa's mouth was a little open, but Mamma was suddenly red and angry. "How old are you,
    Arcadia?"

    "Fourteen and a half, almost."

    Mamma drew a sharp breath and said, "That such people should be let live. The dogs in the
    streets are better. You're running from him, dear, is not?"



    Arcadia nodded.

    Mamma said, "Pappa, go right to Information and find out exactly when the ship to Trantor
    comes to berth. Hurry!"

    But Pappa took one step and stopped. Loud metallic words were booming overhead, and five
    thousand pairs of eyes looked startledly upwards.

    "Men and women," it said, with sharp force. "The airport is being searched for a dangerous
    fugitive, and it is now surrounded. No one can enter and no one can leave. The search will,
    however, be conducted with great speed and no ships will reach or leave berth during the
    interval, so you will not miss your ship. I repeat, no one will miss his ship. The grid will descend.
    None of you will move outside your square until the grid is removed, as otherwise we will be
    forced to use our neuronic whips."

    During the minute or less in which the voice dominated the vast dome of the spaceport's
    waiting room, Arcadia could not have moved if all the evil in the Galaxy had concentrated itself
    into a ball and hurled itself at her.

    They could mean only her. It was not even necessary to formulate that idea as a specific
    thought. But why-

    Callia had engineered her escape. And Callia was of the Second Foundation. Why, then, the
    search now? Had Callia failed? Could Callia fail? Or was this part of the plan, the intricacies of
    which escaped her?

    For a vertiginous moment, she wanted to jump up and shout that she gave up, that she would
    go with them, that ... that-

    But Mamma's hand was on her wrist. "Quick! "Quick! Well go to the lady's room before they
    start."

    Arcadia did not understand. She merely followed blindly. They oozed through the crowd, frozen
    as it was into clumps, with the voice still booming through its last words.

    The grid was descending now, and Pappa, openmouthed, watched it come down. He had
    heard of it and read of it, but had never actually been the object of it. It glimmered in the air,
    simply a series of cross-hatched and tight radiation-beams that set the air aglow in a harmless
    network of flashing light.

    It always was so arranged as to descend slowly from above in order that it might represent a
    falling net with all the terrific psychological implications of entrapment.

    It was at waist-level now, ten feet between glowing lines in each direction. In his own hundred
    square feet, Pappa found himself alone, yet the adjoining squares were crowded. He felt
    himself conspicuously isolated but knew that to move into the greater anonymity of a group
    would have meant crossing one of those glowing lines, stirring an alarm, and bringing down the
    neuronic whip.


    He waited.



    He could make out over the heads of the eerily quiet and waiting mob, the far-off stir that was
    the line of policemen covering the vast floor area, lighted square by lighted square.

    It was a long time before a uniform stepped into his square and carefully noted its co-ordinates
    into an official notebook.

    "Papers!"

    Pappa handed them over, and they were flipped through in expert fashion.

    "You're Preem Palver, native of Trantor, on Kalgan for a month, returning to Trantor. Answer,
    yes or no."

    "Yes, yes."

    "What's your business on Kalgan?"

    "I'm trading representative of our farm co-operative. I've been negotiating terms with the
    Department of Agriculture on Kalgan.

    "Um-m-m. Your wife is with you? Where is she? She is mentioned in your papers."

    "Please. My wife is in the-" He pointed.

    "Hanto," roared the policeman. Another uniform joined him.

    The first one said, dryly, "Another dame in the can, by the Galaxy. The place must be busting
    with them. Write down her name." He indicated the entry in the papers which gave it.

    "Anyone else with you?"

    "My niece."

    "She's not mentioned in the papers."

    "She came separately."

    "Where is she? Never mind, I know. Write down the niece's name, too, Hanto. What's her
    name? Write down Arcadia Palver. You stay right here, Palver. We'll take care of the women
    before we leave."

    Pappa waited interminably. And then, long, long after, Mamma was marching toward him,
    Arcadia's hand firmly in hers, the two policemen trailing behind her.

    They entered Pappa's square, and one said, "Is this noisy old woman your wife?"

    "Yes, sir," said Pappa, placatingly.

    "Then you'd better tell her she's liable to get into trouble if she talks the way she does to the
    First Citizen's police." He straightened his shoulders angrily. "Is this your niece?"

    "Yes, sir."

    "I want her papers."



    Looking straight at her husband, Mamma slightly, but no less firmly, shook her head.

    A short pause, and Pappa said with a weak smile, "I don't think I can do that."

    "What do you mean you can't do that?" The policeman thrust out a hard palm. "Hand it over."
    "Diplomatic immunity," said Pappa, softly.

    "What do you mean?"

    "I said I was trading representative of my farm co-operative. I'm accredited to the Kalganian
    government as an official foreign representative and my papers prove it. I showed them to you
    and now I don't want to be bothered any more."

    For a moment, the policeman was taken aback. "I got to see your papers. It's orders."

    "You go away," broke in Mamma, suddenly. "When we want you, we'll send for you, you ... you
    bum. "

    The policeman's lips tightened. "Keep your eye on them, Hanto. I'll get the lieutenant."

    "Break a leg!" called Mamma after him. Someone laughed, and then choked it off suddenly.

    The search was approaching its end. The crowd was growing dangerously restless. Forty-five
    minutes had elapsed since the grid had started falling and that is too long for best effects.
    Lieutenant Dirige threaded his way hastily, therefore, toward the dense center of the mob.

    "Is this the girl?" he asked wearily. He looked at her and she obviously fitted the description. All
    this for a child.

    He said, "Her papers, if you please?"

    Pappa began, "I have already explained-"

    "I know what you have explained, and I'm sorry," said the lieutenant, "but I have my orders, and
    I can't help them. If you care to make a protest later, you may. Meanwhile, if necessary, I must
    use force."

    There was a pause, and the lieutenant waited patiently.

    Then Pappa said, huskily, "Give me your papers, Arcadia."

    Arcadia shook her head in panic, but Pappa nodded his head. "Don't be afraid. Give them to
    me."

    Helplessly she reached out and let the documents change hands. Pappa fumbled them open
    and looked carefully through them, then handed them over. The lieutenant in his turn looked
    through them carefully. For a long moment, he raised his eyes to rest them on Arcadia, and
    then he closed the booklet with a sharp snap.

    "All in order," he said. "All right, men."

    He left, and in two minutes, scarcely more, the grid was gone, and the voice above signified a



    back-to-normal. The noise of the crowd, suddenly released, rose high.

    Arcadia said: "How ... how-"

    Pappa said, "Sh-h. Don't say a word. Let's better go to the ship. It should be in the berth soon."

    They were on the ship. They had a private stateroom and a table to themselves in the dining
    room. Two light-years already separated them from Kalgan, and Arcadia finally dared to broach
    the subject again.

    She said, "But they were after me, Mr. Palver, and they must have had my description and all
    the details. Why did he let me go?"

    And Pappa smiled broadly over his roast beef. "Well, Arcadia, child, it was easy. When you've
    been dealing with agents and buyers and competing co-operatives, you learn some of the
    tricks. I've had twenty years or more to learn them in. You see, child, when the lieutenant
    opened your papers, he found a five hundred credit bill inside, folded up small. Simple, no?"

    "I’ll pay you back- Honest, I've got lots of money."

    "Well," Pappa's broad face broke into an embarrassed smile, as he waved it away. "For a
    country-woman-"

    Arcadia desisted. "But what if he'd taken the money and turned me in anyway. And accused me
    of bribery."

    "And give up five hundred credits? I know these people better than you do, girl."

    But Arcadia knew that he did not know people better. Not these people. In her bed that night,
    she considered carefully, and knew that no bribe would have stopped a police lieutenant in the
    matter of catching her unless that had been planned. They didn't want to catch her, yet had
    made every motion of doing so, nevertheless.

    Why? To make sure she left? And for Trantor? Were the obtuse and soft-hearted couple she
    was with now only a pair of tools in the hands of the Second Foundation, as helpless as she
    herself?

    They must be!

    Or were they?

    It was all so useless. How could she fight them. Whatever she did, it might only be what those
    terrible omnipotents wanted her to do.

    Yet she had to outwit them. Had to. Had to! Had to!!

    Beginning of War

    For reason or reasons unknown to members of the Galaxy at the time of the era under
    discussion, Intergalactic Standard Time defines its fundamental unit, the second, as the time in
    which light travels 299,776 kilometers. 86,400 seconds are arbitrarily set equal to one
    Intergalactic Standard Day; and 365 of these days to one Intergalactic Standard Year.

    Why 299,776?- Or 86,400?- Or 365?

    Tradition, says the historian, begging the question. Because of certain and various mysterious
    numerical relationships, say the mystics, cultists, numerologists, metaphysicists. Because the
    original home-planet of humanity had certain natural periods of rotation and revolution from
    which those relationships could be derived, say a very few.

    No one really knew.

    Nevertheless, the date on which the Foundation cruiser, the Hober Mallow met the Kalganian
    squadron, headed by the Fearless, and, upon refusing to allow a search party to board, was
    blasted into smoldering wreckage was 185; 11692 G.E. That is, it was the 185th day of the
    1 1 ,692nd year of the Galactic Era which dated from the accession of the first Emperor of the
    traditional Kamble dynasty. It was also 1 85; 41 9 A.S. - dating from the birth of Seldon - or 1 85;
    348 Y.F. - dating from the establishment of the Foundation. On Kalgan it was 185; 56 F.C. -
    dating from the establishment of the First Citizenship by the Mule. In each case, of course, for
    convenience, the year was so arranged as to yield the same day number regardless of the
    actual day upon which the era began.

    And, in addition, to all the millions of worlds of the Galaxy, there were millions of local times,
    based on the motions of their own particular heavenly neighbors.

    But whichever you choose: 185; 11 692-41 9-348-56 - or anything - it was this day which
    historians later pointed to when they spoke of the start of the Stettinian war.

    Yet to Dr. Darell, it was none of these at all. It was simply and quite precisely the thirty-second
    day since Arcadia had left Terminus.

    What it cost Darell to maintain stolidity through these days was not obvious to everyone.

    But Elvett Semic thought he could guess. Fie was an old man and fond of saying that his
    neuronic sheaths had calcified to the point where his thinking processes were stiff and
    unwieldy. Fie invited and almost welcomed the universal underestimation of his decaying
    powers by being the first to laugh at them. But his eyes were none the less seeing for being
    faded; his mind none the less experienced and wise, for being no longer agile.

    Fie merely twisted his pinched lips and said, "Why don't you do something about it?"

    The sound was a physical jar to Darell, under which he winced. Fie said, gruffly, "Where were
    we?"


    Semic regarded him with grave eyes. "You'd better do something about the girl." FHis sparse,
    yellow teeth showed in a mouth that was open in inquiry.



    But Darell replied coldly, "The question is: Can you get a Symes-Molff Resonator in the range
    required?"

    Well, I said I could and you weren't listening-"

    "I'm sorry, Elvett. It's like this. What we're doing now can be more important to everyone in the
    Galaxy than the question of whether Arcadia is safe. At least, to everyone but Arcadia and
    myself, and I'm willing to go along with the majority. How big would the Resonator be?"

    Semic looked doubtful, "I don't know. You can find it somewheres in the catalogues."

    "About how big. A ton? A pound? A block long?"

    "Oh, I thought you meant exactly. It's a little jigger." He indicated the first joint of his thumb.
    "About that."

    "All right, can you do something like this?" He sketched rapidly on the pad he held in his lap,
    then passed it over to the old physicist, who peered at it doubtfully, then chuckled.

    "Y'know, the brain gets calcified when you get as old as I am. What are you trying to do?"

    Darell hesitated. He longed desperately, at the moment, for the physical knowledge locked in
    the other's brain, so that he need not put his thought into words. But the longing was useless,
    and he explained.

    Semic was shaking his head. "You'd need hyper-relays. The only things that would work fast
    enough. A thundering lot of them."

    "But it can be built?"

    "Well, sure."

    "Can you get all the parts? I mean, without causing comment? In line with your general work."

    Semic lifted his upper lip. "Can't get fifty hyper-relays? I wouldn't use that many in my whole
    life."

    "We're on a defense project, now. Can't you think of something harmless that would use them?
    We've got the money."

    "Hm-m-m. Maybe I can think of something."

    "How small can you make the whole gadget?"

    "Hyper-relays can be had micro-size ... wiring ... tubes - Space, you've got a few hundred
    circuits there."

    "I know. How big?"

    Semic indicated with his hands.

    "Too big," said Darell. "I've got to swing it from my belt"



    Slowly, he was crumpling his sketch into a tight ball. When it was a hard, yellow grape, he
    dropped it into the ash tray and it was gone with the tiny white flare of molecular decomposition.

    He said, "Who's at your door?"

    Semic leaned over his desk to the little milky screen above the door signal. He said, "The
    young fellow, Anthor. Someone with him, too."

    Darell scraped his chair back. "Nothing about this, Semic, to the others yet. It's deadly
    knowledge, if they find out, and two lives are enough to risk."

    Pelleas Anthor was a pulsing vortex of activity in Semic's office, which, somehow, managed to
    partake of the age of its occupant. In the slow turgor of the quiet room, the loose, summery
    sleeves of Anthor's tunic seemed still a-quiver with the outer breezes.

    He said, "Dr. Darell, Dr. Semic - Orum Dirige."

    The other man was tall. A long straight nose that lent his thin face a saturnine appearance. Dr.
    Darell held out a hand.

    Anthor smiled slightly. "Police Lieutenant Dirige," he amplified. Then, significantly, "Of Kalgan."

    And Darell turned to stare with force at the young man. "Police Lieutenant Dirige of Kalgan," he
    repeated, distinctly. "And you bring him here. Why?"

    "Because he was the last man on Kalgan to see your daughter. Hold, man."

    Anthor's look of triumph was suddenly one of concern, and he was between the two, struggling
    violently with Darell. Slowly, and not gently, he forced the older man back into the chair.

    "What are you trying to do?" Anthor brushed a lock of brown hair from his forehead, tossed a
    hip lightly upon the desk, and swung a leg, thoughtfully. "I thought I was bringing you good
    news."

    Darell addressed the policeman directly, "What does he mean by calling you the last man to
    see my daughter? Is my daughter dead? Please tell me without preliminary." His face was
    white with apprehension.

    Lieutenant Dirige said expressionlessly, "‘Last man on Kalgan' was the phrase. She's not on
    Kalgan now. I have no knowledge past that."

    "Here," broke in Anthor, "let me put it straight. Sorry if I overplayed the drama a bit, Doc. You're
    so inhuman about this, I forget you have feelings. In the first place, Lieutenant Dirige is one of
    us. He was born on Kalgan, but his father was a Foundation man brought to that planet in the
    service of the Mule. I answer for the lieutenant's loyalty to the Foundation.

    "Now I was in touch with him the day after we stopped getting the daily report from Munn-"

    "Why?" broke in Darell, fiercely. "I thought it was quite decided that we were not to make a
    move in the matter. You were risking their lives and ours."

    "Because," was the equally fierce retort, "I've been involved in this game for longer than you.



    Because I know of certain contacts on Kalgan of which you know nothing. Because I act from
    deeper knowledge, do you understand?"

    "I think you're completely mad."

    "Will you listen?"

    A pause, and Darell's eyes dropped.

    Anthor's lips quirked into a half smile, "All right, Doc. Give me a few minutes. Tell him, Dirige."

    Dirige spoke easily: "As far as I know, Dr. Darell, your daughter is at Trantor. At least, she had
    a ticket to Trantor at the Eastern Spaceport. She was with a Trading Representative from that
    planet who claimed she was his niece. Your daughter seems to have a queer collection of
    relatives, doctor. That was the second uncle she had in a period of two weeks, eh? The
    Trantorian even tried to bribe me - probably thinks that's why they got away." He smiled grimly
    at the thought.

    "How was she?"

    "Unharmed, as far as I could see. Frightened. I don't blame her for that. The whole department
    was after her. I still don't know why."

    Darell drew a breath for what seemed the first time in several minutes. He was conscious of the
    trembling of his hands and controlled them with an effort. "Then she's all right. This Trading
    Representative, who was he? Go back to him. What part does he play in it?"

    "I don't know. Do you know anything about Trantor?"

    "I lived there once."

    "It's an agricultural world, now. Exports animal fodder and grains, mostly. High quality! They sell
    them all over the Galaxy. There are a dozen or two farm co-operatives on the planet and each
    has its representatives overseas. Shrewd sons of guns, too- I knew this one's record. He'd
    been on Kalgan before, usually with his wife. Perfectly honest. Perfectly harmless."

    "Um-m-m," said Anthor. "Arcadia was born in Trantor, wasn't she, Doc?"

    Darell nodded.

    "It hangs together, you see. She wanted to go away - quickly and far - and Trantor would
    suggest itself. Don't you think so?"

    Darell said: "Why not back here?"

    "Perhaps she was being pursued and felt that she had to double off in a new angle, eh?'

    Dr. Darell lacked the heart to question further. Well, then, let her be safe on Trantor, or as safe
    as one could be anywhere in this dark and horrible Galaxy. He groped toward the door, felt
    Anthor's light touch on his sleeve, and stopped, but did not turn.

    "Mind if I go home with you, Doc?"



    "You're welcome," was the automatic response.

    By evening, the exteriormost reaches of Dr. Darell's personality, the ones that made immediate
    contact with other people had solidified once more. He had refused to eat his evening meal and
    had, instead, with feverish insistence, returned to the inchwise advance into the intricate
    mathematics of encephalographic analysis.

    It was not till nearly midnight, that he entered the living room again.

    Pelleas Anthor was still there, twiddling at the controls of the video. The footsteps behind him
    caused him to glance over his shoulder.

    "Hi. Aren't you in bed yet? I've been spending hours on the video, trying to get something other
    than bulletins. It seems the F.S. Hober Mallow is delayed in course and hasn't been heard
    from"

    "Really? What do they suspect?"

    "What do you think? Kalganian skulduggery. There are reports that Kalganian vessels were
    sighted in the general space sector in which the Hober Mallow was last heard from?"

    Darell shrugged, and Anthor rubbed his forehead doubtfully.

    "Look doc," he said, "why don't you go to Trantor?"

    "Why should I?"

    "Because "You're no good to us here. You're not yourself. You can't be. And you could
    accomplish a purpose by going to Trantor, too. The old Imperial Library with the complete
    records of the Proceedings of the Seldon Commission are there-"

    "No! The Library has been picked clean and it hasn't helped anyone."

    "It helped Ebling Mis once."

    "How do you know? Yes, he said he found the Second Foundation, and my mother killed him
    five seconds later as the only way to keep him from unwittingly revealing its location to the
    Mule. But in doing so, she also, you realize, made it impossible ever to tell whether Mis really
    did know the location. After all, no one else has ever been able to deduce the truth from those
    records."

    "Ebling Mis, if you'll remember, was working under the driving impetus of the Mule's mind."

    "I know that, too, but Mis' mind was, by that very token, in an abnormal state. Do you and I
    know anything about the properties of a mind under the emotional control of another; about its
    abilities and shortcomings? In any case, I will not go to Trantor."

    Anthor frowned, "Well, why the vehemence? I merely suggested it as - well, by Space, I don't
    understand you. You look ten years older. You're obviously having a hellish time of it. You're
    not doing anything of value here. If I were you, I'd go and get the girl."

    "Exactly! It's what I want to do, too. That's why I won't do it. Look, Anthor, and try to understand.



    You're playing - we're both playing - with something completely beyond our powers to fight. In
    cold blood, if you have any, you know that, whatever you may think in your moments of
    quixoticism.

    "For fifty years, we've known that the Second Foundation is the real descendent and pupil of
    Seldonian mathematics. What that means, and you know that, too, is that nothing in the Galaxy
    happens which does not play a part in their reckoning. To us, all life is a series of accidents, to
    be met with by improvisations To them, all life is purposive and should be met by
    precalculation.

    "But they have their weakness. Their work is statistical and only the mass action of humanity is
    truly inevitable. Now how / play a part, as an individual, in the foreseen course of history, I don't
    know. Perhaps I have no definite part, since the Plan leaves individuals to indeterminacy and
    free will. But I am important and they - they , you understand - may at least have calculated my
    probable reaction. So I distrust, my impulses, my desires, my probable reactions.

    "I would rather present them with an improbable reaction. I will stay here, despite the fact that I
    yearn very desperately to leave. "No! Because I yearn very desperately to leave."

    The younger man smiled sourly. "You don't know your own mind as well as they might.

    Suppose that - knowing you - they might count on what you think, merely think, is the
    improbable reaction, simply by knowing in advance what your line of reasoning would be."

    "In that case, there is no escape. For if I follow the reasoning you have just outlined and go to
    Trantor, they may have foreseen that, too. There is an endless cycle of

    double-double-double-double-crosses. No matter how far I follow that cycle, I can only either go
    or stay. The intricate act of luring my daughter halfway across the Galaxy cannot be meant to
    make me stay where I am, since I would most certainly have stayed if they had done nothing. It
    can only be to make me move, and so I will stay.

    "And besides, Anthor, not everything bears the breath of the Second Foundation; not all events
    are the results of their puppeting. They may have had nothing to do with Arcadia's leave-taking,
    and she may be safe on Trantor when all the rest of us are dead."

    "No," said Anthor, sharply, "now you are off the track."

    "You have an alternative interpretation?"

    "I have - if you’ll listen."

    "Oh, go ahead. I don't lack patience."

    "Well, then - how well do you know your own daughter?"

    "Flow well can any individual know any other? Obviously, my knowledge is inadequate."

    "So is mine on that basis, perhaps even more so - but at least, I viewed her with fresh eyes.
    Item one: She is a ferocious little romantic, the only child of an ivory-tower academician,
    growing up in an unreal world of video and book-film adventure. She lives in a weird
    self-constructed fantasy of espionage and intrigue. Item two: She's intelligent about it; intelligent



    enough to outwit us, at any rate. She planned carefully to overhear our first conference and
    succeeded. She planned carefully to go to Kalgan with Munn and succeeded. Item three: She
    has an unholy hero-worship of her grandmother - your mother - who defeated the Mule.

    "I'm right so far, I think? All right, then. Now, unlike you, I've received a complete report from
    Lieutenant Dirige and, in addition, my sources of information on Kalgan are rather complete,
    and all sources check. We know, for instance, that Homir Munn, in conference with the Lord of
    Kalgan was refused admission to the Mule's Palace, and that this refusal was suddenly
    abrogated after Arcadia had spoken to Lady Callia, the First Citizen's very good friend."

    Darell interrupted. "And how do you know all this?"

    "For one thing, Munn was interviewed by Dirige as part of the police campaign to locate
    Arcadia. Naturally, we have a complete transcript of the questions and answers.

    "And take Lady Callia herself. It is rumored that she has lost Stettin's interest, but the rumor
    isn't borne out by facts. She not only remains unreplaced; is not only able to mediate the lord's
    refusal to Munn into an acceptance; but can even engineer Arcadia's escape openly. Why, a
    dozen of the soldiers about Stettin's executive mansion testified that they were seen together
    on the last evening. Yet she remains unpunished. This despite the fact that Arcadia was
    searched for with every appearance of diligence."

    "But what is your conclusion from all this torrent of ill-connection?"

    "That Arcadia's escape was arranged."

    "As I said."

    "With this addition. That Arcadia must have known it was arranged; that Arcadia, the bright little
    girl who saw cabals everywhere, saw this one and followed your own type of reasoning. They
    wanted her to return to the Foundation, and so she went to Trantor, instead. But why Trantor?"

    "Well, why?"

    "Because that is where Bayta, her idolized grandmother, escaped when she was in flight.
    Consciously or unconsciously, Arcadia imitated that. I wonder, then, if Arcadia was fleeing the
    same enemy."

    "The Mule?" asked Darell with polite sarcasm.

    "Of course not. I mean, by the enemy, a mentality that she could not fight. She was running
    from the Second Foundation, or such influence thereof as could be found on Kalgan."

    "What influence is this you speak of?"

    "Do you expect Kalgan to be immune from that ubiquitous menace? We both have come to the
    conclusion, somehow, that Arcadia's escape was arranged. Right? She was searched for and
    found, but deliberately allowed to slip away by Dirige. By Dirige, do you understand? But how
    was that? Because he was our man. But how did they know that? Were they counting on him to
    be a traitor? Eh, doc?"



    "Now you're saying that they honestly meant to recapture her. Frankly, you're tiring me a bit,
    Anthor. Finish your say; I want to go to bed."

    "My say is quickly finished." Anthor reached for a small group of photo-records in his inner
    pocket. It was the familiar wigglings of the encephalograph. "Dirige's brainwaves," Anthor said,
    casually, "taken since he returned."

    It was quite visible to Darell's naked eye, and his face was gray when he looked up. "Fie is
    Controlled."

    "Exactly. Fie allowed Arcadia to escape not because he was our man but because he was the
    Second Foundation's."

    "Even after he knew she was going to Trantor, and not to Terminus."

    Anthor shrugged. "Fie had been geared to let her go. There was no way he could modify that.
    Fie was only a tool, you see. It was just that Arcadia followed the least probable course, and is
    probably safe. Or at least safe until such time as the Second Foundation can modify the plans
    to take into account this changed state of affairs-"

    Fie paused. The little signal light on the video set was flashing. On an independent circuit, it
    signified the presence of emergency news. Darell saw it, too, and with the mechanical
    movement of long habit turned on the video. They broke in upon the middle of a sentence but
    before its completion, they knew that the Hober Mallow, or the wreck thereof, had been found
    and that, for the first time in nearly half a century, the Foundation was again at war.

    Anthor's jaw was set in a hard line. "All right, doc, you heard that. Kalgan has attacked; and
    Kalgan is under the control of the Second Foundation. Will you follow your daughter's lead and
    move to Trantor?"

    "No. I will risk it. Here."

    "Dr. Darell. You are not as intelligent as your daughter. I wonder how far you can be trusted."
    His long level stare held Darell for a moment, and then without a word, he left.

    And Darell was left in uncertainty and - almost - despair.

    Unheeded, the video was a medley of excited sight-sound, as it described in nervous detail the
    first hour of the war between Kalgan and the Foundation.

    17

    War

    The mayor of the Foundation brushed futilely at the picket fence of hair that rimmed his skull.
    He sighed. "The years that we have wasted; the chances we have thrown away. I make no
    recriminations, Dr. Darell, but we deserve defeat."


    Darell said, quietly, "I see no reason for lack of confidence in events, sir.



    "Lack of confidence! Lack of confidence! By the Galaxy, Dr. Darell, on what would you base
    any other attitude? Come here-"

    He half-led half-forced Darell toward the limpid ovoid cradled gracefully on its tiny force-field
    support. At a touch of the mayor's hand, it glowed within - an accurate three-dimensional
    model of the Galactic double-spiral.

    "In yellow," said the mayor, excitedly, "we have that region of Space under Foundation control;
    in red, that under Kalgan."

    What Darell saw was a crimson sphere resting within a stretching yellow fist that surrounded it
    on all sides but that toward the center of the Galaxy.

    "Galactography," said the mayor, "is our greatest enemy. Our admirals make no secret of our
    almost hopeless, strategic position. Observe. The enemy has inner lines of communication. He
    is concentrated; can meet us on all sides with equal ease. He can defend himself with minimum
    force.

    "We are expanded. The average distance between inhabited systems within the Foundation is
    nearly three times that within Kalgan. To go from Santanni to Locris, for instance, is a voyage of
    twenty-five hundred parsecs for us, but only eight hundred parsecs for them, if we remain within
    our respective territories-"

    Darell said, "I understand all that, sir."

    "And you do not understand that it may mean defeat."

    "There is more than distance to war. I say we cannot lose. It is quite impossible."

    "And why do you say that?"

    "Because of my own interpretation of the Seldon Plan."

    "Oh," the mayor's lips twisted, and the hands behind his back flapped one within the other,

    "then you rely, too, on the mystical help of the Second Foundation."

    "No. Merely on the help of inevitability - and of courage and persistence."

    And yet behind his easy confidence, he wondered-

    What if-

    Well- What if Anthor were right, and Kalgan were a direct tool of the mental wizards. What if it
    was their purpose to defeat and destroy the Foundation. No! It made no sense!

    And yet-

    He smiled bitterly. Always the same. Always that peering and peering through the opaque
    granite which, to the enemy, was so transparent.

    Nor were the galactographic verities of the situation lost upon Stettin.



    The Lord of Kalgan stood before a twin of the Galactic model which the mayor and Darell had
    inspected. Except that where the mayor frowned, Stettin smiled.

    His admiral's uniform glistered imposingly upon his massive figure. The crimson sash of the
    Order of the Mule awarded him by the former First Citizen whom six months later he had
    replaced somewhat forcefully, spanned his chest diagonally from right shoulder to waist. The
    Silver Star with Double Comets and Swords sparkled brilliantly upon his left shoulder.

    He addressed the six men of his general staff whose uniforms were only less grandiloquent
    than his own, and his First Minister as well, thin and gray - a darkling cobweb, lost in the
    brightness.

    Stettin said, "I think the decisions are clear. We can afford to wait. To them, every day of delay
    will be another blow at their morale. If they attempt to defend all portions of their realm, they will
    be spread thin and we can strike through in two simultaneous thrusts here and here." He
    indicated the directions on the Galactic model - two lances of pure white shooting through the
    yellow fist from the red ball it inclosed, cutting Terminus off on either side in a tight arc. "In such
    a manner, we cut their fleet into three parts which can be defeated in detail. If they concentrate,
    they give up two-thirds of their dominions voluntarily and will probably risk rebellion."

    The First Minister's thin voice alone seeped through the hush that followed. "In six months," he
    said, "the Foundation will grow six months stronger. Their resources are greater, as we all
    know, their navy is numerically stronger; their manpower is virtually inexhaustible. Perhaps a
    quick thrust would be safer."

    His was easily the least influential voice in the room. Lord Stettin smiled and made a flat
    gesture with his hand. "The six months - or a year, if necessary - will cost us nothing. The men
    of the Foundation cannot prepare; they are ideologically incapable of it. It is in their very
    philosophy to believe that the Second Foundation will save them. But not this time, eh?"

    The men in the room stirred uneasily.

    "You lack confidence, I believe," said Stettin, frigidly. "Is it necessary once again to describe the
    reports of our agents in Foundation territory, or to repeat the findings of Mr. Homir Munn, the
    Foundation agent now in our ... uh ... service? Let us adjourn, gentlemen."

    Stettin returned to his private chambers with a fixed smile still on his face. He sometimes
    wondered about this Homir Munn. A queer water-spined fellow who certainly did not bear out
    his early promise. And yet he crawled with interesting information that carried conviction with it
    - particularly when Callia was present.

    His smile broadened. That fat fool had her uses, after all. At least, she got more with her
    wheedling out of Munn than he could, and with less trouble. Why not give her to Munn? He
    frowned. Callia. She and her stupid jealousy. Space! If he still had the Darell girl- Why hadn't he
    ground her skull to powder for that?

    He couldn't quite put his finger on the reason.

    Maybe because she got along with Munn. And he needed Munn. It was Munn, for instance,
    who had demonstrated that, at least in the belief of the Mule, there was no Second Foundation.



    His admirals needed that assurance.


    He would have liked to make the proofs public, but it was better to let the Foundation believe in
    their nonexistent help. Was it actually Callia who had pointed that out? That's right. She had
    said-

    Oh, nonsense! She couldn't have said anything.

    And yet-

    He shook his head to clear it and passed on.


    18

    Ghost of a World

    Trantor was a world in dregs and rebirth. Set like a faded jewel in the midst of the bewildering
    crowd of suns at the center of the Galaxy - in the heaps and clusters of stars piled high with
    aimless prodigality - it alternately dreamed of past and future.

    Time had been when the insubstantial ribbons of control had stretched out from its metal
    coating to the very edges of stardom. It had been a single city, housing four hundred billion
    administrators; the mightiest capital that had ever been.

    Until the decay of the Empire eventually reached it and in the Great Sack of a century ago, its
    drooping powers had been bent back upon themselves and broken forever. In the blasting ruin
    of death, the metal shell that circled the planet wrinkled and crumpled into an aching mock of its
    own grandeur.

    The survivors tore up the metal plating and sold it to other planets for seed and cattle. The soil
    was uncovered once more and the planet returned to its beginnings. In the spreading areas of
    primitive agriculture, it forgot its intricate and colossal past.

    Or would have but for the still mighty shards that heaped their massive ruins toward the sky in
    bitter and dignified silence.

    Arcadia watched the metal rim of the horizon with a stirring of the heart. The village in which the
    Palvers lived was but a huddle of houses to her - small and primitive. The fields that
    surrounded it were golden-yellow, wheat-clogged tracts.

    But there, just past the reaching point was the memory of the past, still glowing in unrusted
    splendor, and burning with fire where the sun of Trantor caught it in gleaming highlights. She
    had been there once during the months since she had arrived at Trantor. She had climbed onto
    the smooth, unjointed pavement and ventured into the silent dust-streaked structures, where
    the light entered through the jags of broken walls and partitions.

    It had been solidified heartache. It had been blasphemy.

    She had left, clangingly - running until her feet pounded softly on earth once more.



    And then she could only look back longingly. She dared not disturb that mighty brooding once
    more.

    Somewhere on this world, she knew, she had been born - near the old Imperial Library, which
    was the veriest Trantor of Trantor. It was the sacred of the sacred; the holy of holies! Of all the
    world, it alone had survived the Great Sack and for a century it had remained complete and
    untouched; defiant of the universe.

    There Hari Seldon and his group had woven their unimaginable web. There Ebling Mis pierced
    the secret, and sat numbed in his vast surprise, until he was killed to prevent the secret from
    going further.

    There at the Imperial Library, her grandparents had lived for ten years, until the Mule died, and
    they could return to the reborn Foundation.

    There at the Imperial Library, her own father returned with his bride to find the Second
    Foundation once again, but failed. There, she had been born and there her mother had died.

    She would have liked to visit the Library, but Preem Palver shook his round head. "It's
    thousands of miles, Arkady, and there's so much to do here. Besides, it's not good to bother
    there. You know; it's a shrine-"

    But Arcadia knew that he had no desire to visit the Library; that it was a case of the Mule's
    Palace over again. There was this superstitious fear on the part of the pygmies of the present
    for the relies of the giants of the past.

    Yet it would have been horrible to feel a grudge against the funny little man for that. She had
    been on Trantor now for nearly three months and in all that time, he and she - Pappa and
    Mamma - had been wonderful to her-

    And what was her return? Why, to involve them in the common ruin. Had she warned them that
    she was marked for destruction, perhaps? No! She let them assume the deadly role of
    protectors.

    Her conscience panged unbearably - yet what choice had she?

    She stepped reluctantly down the stairs to breakfast. The voices reached her.

    Preem Palver had tucked the napkin down his shirt collar with a twist of his plump neck and
    had reached for his poached eggs with an uninhibited satisfaction.

    "I was down in the city yesterday, Mamma," he said, wielding his fork and nearly drowning the
    words with a capacious mouthful.

    "And what is down in the city, Pappa?" asked Mamma indifferently, sitting down, looking
    sharply about the table, and rising again for the salt.

    "Ah, not so good. A ship came in from out Kalgan-way with newspapers from there. It's war
    there."


    War! So! Well, let them break their heads, if they have no more sense inside. Did your pay



    check come yet? Pappa, I'm telling you again. You warn old man Cosker this isn't the only
    cooperative in the world. It's bad enough they pay you what I'm ashamed to tell my friends, but
    at least on time they could be!"

    "Time; shmime," said Pappa, irritably. "Look, don't make me silly talk at breakfast, it should
    choke me each bite in the throat," and he wreaked havoc among the buttered toast as he said
    it. He added, somewhat more moderately, "The fighting is between Kalgan and the Foundation,
    and for two months, they've been at it."

    His hands lunged at one another in mock-representation of a space fight.

    "Um-m-m. And what's doing?"

    "Bad for the Foundation. Well, you saw Kalgan; all soldiers. They were ready. The Foundation
    was not, and so - poof T

    And suddenly, Mamma laid down her fork and hissed, "Fool!"

    "Huh?"

    "Dumb-head! Your big mouth is always moving and wagging."

    She was pointing quickly and when Pappa looked over his shoulder, there was Arcadia, frozen
    in the doorway.

    She said, "The Foundation is at war?"

    Pappa looked helplessly at Mamma, then nodded.

    "And they're losing?"

    Again the nod.

    Arcadia felt the unbearable catch in her throat, and slowly approached the table. "Is it over?"
    she whispered.

    "Over?" repeated Pappa, with false heartiness. "Who said it was over? In war, lots of things can
    happen. And ... and-"

    "Sit down, darling," said Mamma, soothingly. "No one should talk before breakfast. You're not in
    a healthy condition with no food in the stomach."

    But Arcadia ignored her. "Are the Kalganians on Terminus?"

    "No," said Pappa, seriously. "The news is from last week, and Terminus is still fighting. This is
    honest. I'm telling the truth. And the Foundation is still strong. Do you want me to get you the
    newspapers?"

    "Yes!"

    She read them over what she could eat of her breakfast and her eyes blurred as she read.
    Santanni and Korell were gone - without a fight. A squadron of the Foundation's navy had been
    trapped in the sparsely-sunned Ifni sector and wiped out to almost the last ship.



    And now the Foundation was back to the Four-Kingdom core - the original Realm which had
    been built up under Salvor Hardin, the first mayor. But still it fought - and still there might be a
    chance-and whatever happened, she must inform her father. She must somehow reach his ear.
    She must!

    But how? With a war in the way.

    She asked Pappa after breakfast, "Are you going out on a new mission soon, Mr. Palver?"

    Pappa was on the large chair on the front lawn, sunning himself. A fat cigar smoldered between
    his plump fingers and he looked like a beatific pug-dog.

    "A mission?" he repeated, lazily. "Who knows? It's a nice vacation and my leave isn't up. Why
    talk about new missions? You're restless, Arkady?"

    "Me? No, I like it here. You're very good to me, you and Mrs. Palver."

    Fie waved his hand at her, brushing away her words.

    Arcadia said, "I was thinking about the war."

    "But don't think about it. What can you do? If it's something you can't help, why hurt yourself
    over it?"

    "But I was thinking that the Foundation has lost most of its farming worlds. They're probably
    rationing food there."

    Pappa looked uncomfortable. "Don't worry. It'll be all right."

    She scarcely listened. "I wish I could carry food to them, that's what. You know after the Mule
    died, and the Foundation rebelled, Terminus was just about isolated for a time and General
    Flan Pritcher, who succeeded the Mule for a while was laying siege to it. Food was running
    awfully low and my father says that his father told him that they only had dry amino-acid
    concentrates that tasted terrible. Why, one egg cost two hundred credits. And then they broke
    the siege just in time and food ships came through from Santanni. It must have been an awful
    time. Probably it's happening all over, now."

    There was a pause, and then Arcadia said, "You know, I'll bet the Foundation would be willing
    to pay smuggler's prices for food now. Double and triple and more. Gee, if any co-operative, f'r
    instance, here on Trantor took over the job, they might lose some ships, but, I'll bet they'd be
    war millionaires before it was over. The Foundation Traders in the old days used to do that all
    the time. There'd be a war, so they'd sell whatever was needed bad and take their chances.
    Golly, they used to make as much as two million dollars out of one trip - profit. That was just
    out of what they could carry on one ship, too."

    Pappa stirred. His cigar had gone out, unnoticed. "A deal for food, huh? Hm-m-m- But the
    Foundation is so far away."

    "Oh, I know. I guess you couldn't do it from here. If you took a regular liner you probably
    couldn't get closer than Massena or Smushyk, and after that you'd have to hire a small



    scoutship or something to slip you through the lines."

    Pappa's hand brushed at his hair, as he calculated.

    Two weeks later, arrangements for the mission were completed. Mamma railed for most of the
    time- First, at the incurable obstinacy with which he courted suicide. Then, at the incredible
    obstinacy with which he refused to allow her to accompany him.

    Pappa said, "Mamma, why do you act like an old lady. I can't take you. It's a man's work. What
    do you think a war is? Fun? Child's play?"

    "Then why do you go? Are you a man, you old fool - with a leg and half an arm in the grave.

    Let some of the young ones go - not a fat bald-head like you?"

    "I'm not a bald-head," retorted Pappa, with dignity. "I got yet lots of hair. And why should it not
    be me that gets the commission? Why, a young fellow? Listen, this could mean millions?"

    She knew that and she subsided.

    Arcadia saw him once before he left.

    She said, "Are you going to Terminus?"

    "Why not? You say yourself they need bread and rice and potatoes. Well, I'll make a deal with
    them, and they'll get it."

    "Well, then - just one thing: If you're going to Terminus, could you ... would you see my father?"

    And Pappa's face crinkled and seemed to melt into sympathy, "Oh - and I have to wait for you
    to tell me. Sure, I'll see him. I'll tell him you're safe and everything's O.K., and when the war is
    over, I'll bring you back."

    "Thanks. I'll tell you how to find him. His name is Dr. Toran Darell and he lives in Stanmark.
    That's just outside Terminus City, and you can get a little commuting plane that goes there.
    We’re at 55 Channel Drive."

    "Wait, and I’ll write it down."

    "No, no," Arcadia's arm shot out. "You mustn't write anything down. You must remember - and
    find him without anybody's help."

    Pappa looked puzzled. Then he shrugged his shoulders. "All right, then. It's 55 Channel Drive
    in Stanmark, outside Terminus City, and you commute there by plane. All right?"

    "One other thing."

    "Yes?"

    "Would you tell him something from me?"

    "Sure."

    "I want to whisper it to you."



    He leaned his plump cheek toward her, and the little whispered sound passed from one to the
    other.

    Pappa's eyes were round. "That's what you want me to say? But it doesn't make sense."

    "He'll know what you mean. Just say I sent it and that I said he would know what it means. And
    you say it exactly the way I told you. No different. You won't forget it?"

    "How can I forget it? Five little words. Look-"

    "No, no." She hopped up and down in the intensity of her feelings. "Don't repeat it. Don't ever
    repeat it to anyone. Forget all about it except to my father. Promise me."

    Pappa shrugged again. "I promise! All right!"

    "All right," she said, mournfully, and as he passed down the drive to where the air taxi waited to
    take him to the spaceport, she wondered if she had signed his death warrant. She wondered if
    she would ever see him again.

    She scarcely dared to walk into the house again to face the good, kind Mamma. Maybe when it
    was all over, she had better kill herself for what she had done to them.

    End of War

    QUORISTON, BATTLE OF Fought on 9, 17, 377 F.E. between the forces of the Foundation
    and those of Lord Stettin of Kalgan, it was the last battle of consequence during the
    Interregnum ....

    ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA

    Jole Turbor, in his new role of war correspondent, found his bulk incased in a naval uniform,
    and rather liked it. He enjoyed being back on the air, and some of the fierce helplessness of the
    futile fight against the Second Foundation left him in the excitement of another sort of fight with
    substantial ships and ordinary men.

    To be sure, the Foundation's fight had not been remarkable for victories, but it was still possible
    to be philosophic about the matter. After six months, the hard core of the Foundation was
    untouched, and the hard core of the Fleet was still in being. With the new additions since the
    start of the war, it was almost as strong numerically, and stronger technically, than before the
    defeat at Ifni.

    And meanwhile, planetary defenses were being strengthened; the armed forces better trained;
    administrative efficiency was having some of the water squeezed out of it - and much of the
    Kalganian's conquering fleet was being wallowed down through the necessity of occupying the
    "conquered" territory.


    At the moment, Turbor was with the Third Fleet in the outer reaches of the Anacreonian sector.



    In line with his policy of making this a "little man's war," he was interviewing Fennel Leemor,
    Engineer Third Class, volunteer.

    "Tell us a little about yourself, sailor," said Turbor.

    "Ain't much to tell," Leemor shuffled his feet and allowed a faint, bashful smile to cover his face,
    as though he could see all the millions that undoubtedly could see him at the moment. I’m a
    Locrian. Got a job in an air-car factory; section head and good pay. I'm married; got two kids,
    both girls. Say, I couldn't say hello to them, could I - in case they're listening."

    "Go ahead, sailor. The video is all yours."

    "Gosh, thanks." He burbled, "Hello, Milla, in case you're listening, I'm fine. Is Sunni all right?

    And Tomma? I think of you all the time and maybe I'll be back on furlough after we get back to
    port. I got your food parcel but I'm sending it back. We get our regular mess, but they say the
    civilians are a little tight. I guess that's all."

    "I'll look her up next time I'm on Locris, sailor, and make sure she's not short of food. O.K.?"

    The young man smiled broadly and nodded his head. "Thank you, Mr. Turbor. I’d appreciate
    that."

    "All right. Suppose you tell us, then- You're a volunteer, aren't you?"

    "Sure am. If anyone picks a fight with me, I don't have to wait for anyone to drag me in. I joined
    up the day I heard about the Hober Mallow."

    "That's a fine spirit. Have you seen much action? I notice "You're wearing two battle stars."

    "Ptah."The sailor spat. "Those weren't battles, they were chases. The Kalganians don't fight,
    unless they have odds of five to one or better in their favor. Even then they just edge in and try
    to cut us up ship by ship. Cousin of mine was at Ifni and he was on a ship that got away, the old
    Ebling Mis. He says it was the same there. They had their Main Fleet against just a wing
    division of ours, and down to where we only had five ships left, they kept stalking instead of
    fighting. We got twice as many of their ships at that fight."

    "Then you think we're going to win the war?"

    Sure bet; now that we aren't retreating. Even if things got too bad, that's when I'd expect the
    Second Foundation to step in. We still got the Seldon Plan - and they know it, too."

    Turbor's lips curled a bit. "You're counting on the Second Foundation, then?"

    The answer came with honest surprise. "Well, doesn't everyone?"

    Junior Officer Tippellum stepped into Turbor's room after the visicast. He shoved a cigarette at
    the correspondent and knocked his cap back to a perilous balance on the occiput.


    We picked up a prisoner," he said.
    Yes?"



    "Little crazy fellow. Claims to be a neutral - diplomatic immunity, no less. I don't think they know
    what to do with him. His name's Palvro, Palver, something like that, and he says he's from
    Trantor. Don't know what in space he's doing in a war zone."

    But Turbor had swung to a sitting position on his bunk and the nap he had been about to take
    was forgotten. He remembered quite well his last interview with Darell, the day after war had
    been declared and he was shoving off.

    "Preem Palver," he said. It was a statement.

    Tippellum paused and let the smoke trickle out the sides of his mouth. "Yeah," he said, "how in
    space did you know?"

    "Never mind. Can I see him?"

    "Space, / can't say. The old man has him in his own room for questioning. Everyone figures
    he's a spy."

    "You tell the old man that I know him, if he's who he claims he is. I’ll take the responsibility."

    Captain Dixyl on the flagship of the Third Fleet watched unremittingly at the Grand Detector. No
    ship could avoid being a source of subatomic radiation - not even if it were lying an inert mass
    - and each focal point of such radiation was a little sparkle in the three-dimensional field.

    Each one of the Foundation's ships were accounted for and no sparkle was left over, now that
    the little spy who claimed to be a neutral had been picked up. For a while, that outside ship had
    created a stir in the captain's quarters. The tactics might have needed changing on short notice.
    As it was-

    "Are you sure you have it?" he asked.

    Commander Cenn nodded. "I will take my squadron through hyperspace: radius, 10.00
    parsecs; theta, 268.52 degrees; phi, 84.15 degrees. Return to origin at 1330. Total absence
    11.83 hours."

    "Right. Now we are going to count on pin-point return as regards both space and time.
    Understand?"

    "Yes, captain." He looked at his wrist watch, "My ships will be ready by 0140."

    "Good," said Captain Dixyl.

    The Kalganian squadron was not within detector range now, but they would be soon. There
    was independent information to that effect. Without Cenn's squadron the Foundation forces
    would be badly outnumbered, but the captain was quite confident. Quite confident.

    Preem Palver looked sadly about him. First at the tall, skinny admiral; then at the others,
    everyone in uniform; and now at this last one, big and stout, with his collar open and no tie -
    not like the rest - who said he wanted to speak to him.

    Jole Turbor was saying: "I am perfectly aware, admiral, of the serious possibilities involved



    here, but I tell you that if I can be allowed to speak to him for a few minutes, I may be able to
    settle the current uncertainty."

    "Is there any reason why you can't question him before me?"

    Turbor pursed his lips and looked stubborn. "Admiral," he said, "while I have been attached to
    your ships, the Third Fleet has received an excellent press. You may station men outside the
    door, if you like, and you may return in five minutes. But, meanwhile, humor me a bit, and your
    public relations will not suffer. Do you understand me?"

    He did.

    Then Turbor in the isolation that followed, turned to Palver, and said, "Quickly - what is the
    name of the girl you abducted."

    And Palver could simply stare round-eyed, and shake his head.

    "No nonsense," said Turbor. "If you do not answer, you will be a spy and spies are blasted
    without trial in war time."

    "Arcadia Darell!" gasped Palver.

    "Well! All right, then. Is she safe?"

    Palver nodded.

    "You had better be sure of that, or it won't be well for you."

    "She is in good health, perfectly safe," said Palver, palely.

    The admiral returned, "Well?"

    "The man, sir, is not a spy. You may believe what he tells you. I vouch for him."

    "That so?" The admiral frowned. "Then he represents an agricultural co-operative on Trantor
    that wants to make a trade treaty with Terminus for the delivery of grains and potatoes. Well, all
    right, but he can't leave now."

    "Why not?" asked Palver, quickly.

    "Because we're in the middle of a battle. After it is over - assuming we're still alive - we'll take
    you to Terminus."

    The Kalganian fleet that spanned through space detected the Foundation ships from an
    incredible distance and were themselves detected. Like little fireflies in each other's Grand
    Detectors, they closed in across the emptiness.

    And the Foundation's admiral frowned and said, "This must be their main push. Look at the
    numbers." Then, "They won't stand up before us, though; not if Cenn's detachment can be
    counted on."


    Commander Cenn had left hours before - at the first detection of the coming enemy. There was
    no way of altering the plan now. It worked or it didn't, but the admiral felt quite comfortable. As



    did the officers. As did the men.

    Again watch the fireflies.

    Like a deadly ballet dance, in precise formations, they sparked.

    The Foundation fleet edged slowly backwards. Hours passed and the fleet veered slowly off,
    teasing the advancing enemy slightly off course, then more so.

    In the minds of the dictators of the battle plan, there was a certain volume of space that must
    be occupied by the Kalganian ships. Out from that volume crept the Foundationers; into it
    slipped the Kalganians. Those that passed out again were attacked, suddenly and fiercely.
    Those that stayed within were not touched.

    It all depended on the reluctance of the ships of Lord Stettin to take the initiative themselves -
    on their willingness to remain where none attacked.

    Captain Dixyl stared frigidly at his wrist watch. It was 1310, "We've got twenty minutes," he
    said.

    The lieutenant at his side nodded tensely, "It looks all right so far, captain. We've got more than
    ninety percent of them boxed. If we can keep them that way-"

    "Yes! If-"

    The Foundation ships were drifting forward again - very slowly. Not quick enough to urge a
    Kalganian retreat and just quickly enough to discourage a Kalganian advance. They preferred
    to wait.

    And the minutes passed.

    At 1325, the admiral's buzzer sounded in seventy-five ships of the Foundation's line, and they
    built up to a maximum acceleration towards the front-plane of the Kalganian fleet, itself three
    hundred strong. Kalganian shields flared into action, and the vast energy beams flicked out.
    Every one of the three hundred concentrated in the same direction, towards their mad attackers
    who bore down relentlessly, uncaringly and-

    At 1330, fifty ships under Commander Cenn appeared from nowhere, in one single bound
    through hyperspace to a calculated spot at a calculated time - and were spaced in tearing fury
    at the unprepared Kalganian rear.

    The trap worked perfectly.

    The Kalganians still had numbers on their side, but they were in no mood to count. Their first
    effort was to escape and the formation once broken was only the more vulnerable, as the
    enemy ships bumbled into one another's path.

    After a while, it took on the proportions of a rat hunt.

    Of three hundred Kalganian ships, the core and pride of their fleet, some sixty or less, many in
    a state of near-hopeless disrepair, reached Kalgan once more. The Foundation loss was eight



    ships out of a total of one hundred twenty-five.

    Preem Palver landed on Terminus at the height of the celebration. He found the furore
    distracting, but before he left the planet, he had accomplished two things, and received one
    request.

    The two things accomplished were: 1) the conclusion of an agreement whereby Palver's
    co-operative was to deliver twenty shiploads of certain foodstuffs per month for the next year at
    a war price, without, thanks to the recent battle, a corresponding war risk, and 2) the transfer to
    Dr. Darell of Arcadia's five short words.

    For a startled moment, Darell had stared wide-eyed at him, and then he had made his request.
    It was to carry an answer back to Arcadia. Palver liked it; it was a simple answer and made
    sense. It was: "Come back now. There won't be any danger."

    Lord Stettin was in raging frustration. To watch his every weapon break in his hands; to feel the
    firm fabric of his military might part like the rotten thread it suddenly turned out to be - would
    have turned phlegmaticism itself into flowing lava. And yet he was helpless, and knew it.

    He hadn't really slept well in weeks. He hadn't shaved in three days. He had canceled all
    audiences. His admirals were left to themselves and none knew better than the Lord of Kalgan
    that very little time and no further defeats need elapse before he would have to contend with
    internal rebellion.

    Lev Meirus, First Minister, was no help. He stood there, calm and indecently old, with his thin,
    nervous finger stroking, as always, the wrinkled line from nose to chin.

    "Well," shouted Stettin at him, "contribute something. We stand here defeated, do you
    understand? Defeated! And why? I don't know why. There you have it. I don't know why. Do
    you know why?"

    "I think so," said Meirus, calmly.

    "Treason!" The word came out softly, and other words followed as softly. "You've known of
    treason, and you've kept quiet. You served the fool I ejected from the First Citizenship and you
    think you can serve whatever foul rat replaces me. If you have acted so, I will extract your
    entrails for it and burn them before your living eyes."

    Meirus was unmoved. "I have tried to fill you with my own doubts, not once, but many times. I
    have dinned it in your ears and you have preferred the advice of others because it stuffed your
    ego better. Matters have turned out not as I feared, but even worse. If you do not care to listen
    now, say so, sir, and I shall leave, and, in due course, deal with your successor, whose first act,
    no doubt, will be to sign a treaty of peace."

    Stettin stared at him red-eyed, enormous fists slowly clenching and unclenching. "Speak, you
    gray slug. Speak!"

    "I have told you often, sir, that you are not the Mule. You may control ships and guns but you
    cannot control the minds of your subjects. Are you aware, sir, of who it is you are fighting? You
    fight the Foundation, which is never defeated - the Foundation, which is protected by the



    Seldon Plan - the Foundation, which is destined to form a new Empire."

    "There is no Plan. No longer. Munn has said so."

    "Then Munn is wrong. And if he were right, what then? You and I, sir, are not the people. The
    men and women of Kalgan and its subject worlds believe utterly and deeply in the Seldon Plan
    as do all the inhabitants of this end of the Galaxy. Nearly four hundred years of history teach
    the fact that the Foundation cannot be beaten. Neither the kingdoms nor the warlords nor the
    old Galactic Empire itself could do it."

    "The Mule did it."

    "Exactly, and he was beyond calculation - and you are not. What is worse, the people know
    that you are not. So your ships go into battle fearing defeat in some unknown way. The
    insubstantial fabric of the Plan hangs over them so that they are cautious and look before they
    attack and wonder a little too much. While on the other side, that same insubstantial fabric fills
    the enemy with confidence, removes fear, maintains morale in the face of early defeats. Why
    not? The Foundation has always been defeated at first and has always won in the end.

    "And your own morale, sir? You stand everywhere on enemy territory. Your own dominions
    have not been invaded; are still not in danger of invasion - yet you are defeated. You don't
    believe in the possibility, even, of victory, because you know there is none.

    "Stoop, then, or you will be beaten to your knees. Stoop voluntarily, and you may save a
    remnant. You have depended on metal and power and they have sustained you as far as they
    could. You have ignored mind and morale and they have failed you. Now, take my advice. You
    have the Foundation man, Homir Munn. Release him. Send him back to Terminus and he will
    carry your peace offers."

    Stettin's teeth ground behind his pale, set lips. But what choice had he?

    On the first day of the new year, Homir Munn left Kalgan again. More than six months had
    passed since he had left Terminus and in the interim, a war had raged and faded.

    He had come alone, but he left escorted. He had come a simple man of private life; he left the
    unappointed but nevertheless, actual, ambassador of peace.

    And what had most changed was his early concern over the Second Foundation. He laughed at
    the thought of that: and pictured in luxuriant detail the final revelation to Dr. Darell, to that
    energetic, young competent, Anthor, to all of them-

    He knew. He, Homir Munn, finally knew the truth.

    20



    "I Know ..."


    The last two months of the Stettinian war did not lag for Homir. In his unusual office as Mediator
    Extraordinary, he found himself the center of interstellar affairs, a role he could not help but find
    pleasing.

    There were no further major battles - a few accidental skirmishes that could scarcely count -
    and the terms of the treaty were hammered out with little necessity for concessions on the part
    of the Foundation. Stettin retained his office, but scarcely anything else. His navy was
    dismantled; his possessions outside the home system itself made autonomous and allowed to
    vote for return to previous status, full independence or confederation within the Foundation, as
    they chose.

    The war was formally ended on an asteroid in Terminus' own stellar system; site of the
    Foundation's oldest naval base. Lev Meirus signed for Kalgan, and Homir was an interested
    spectator.

    Throughout all that period he did not see Dr. Darell, nor any of the others. But it scarcely
    mattered. His news would keep - and, as always, he smiled at the thought.

    Dr. Darell returned to Terminus some weeks after VK day, and that same evening, his house
    served as the meeting place for the five men who, ten months earlier, had laid their first plans.

    They lingered over dinner and then over wine as though hesitating to return again to the old
    subject.

    It was Jole Turbor, who, peering steadily into the purple depths of the wineglass with one eye,
    muttered, rather than said, "Well, Homir, you are a man of affairs now, I see. You handled
    matters well."

    "I?" Munn laughed loudly and joyously. For some reason, he had not stuttered in months. "I
    hadn't a thing to do with it. It was Arcadia. By the by, Darell, how is she? She's coming back
    from Trantor, I heard?"

    "You heard correctly," said Darell, quietly. "Her ship should dock within the week." He looked,
    with veiled eyes, at the others, but there were only confused, amorphous exclamations of
    pleasure. Nothing else.

    Turbor said, "Then it's over, really. Who would have predicted all this ten months ago. Munn's
    been to Kalgan and back. Arcadia's been to Kalgan and Trantor and is coming back. We've had
    a war and won it, by Space. They tell you that the vast sweeps of history can be predicted, but
    doesn't it seem conceivable that all that has just happened, with its absolute confusion to those
    of us who lived through it, couldn't possibly have been predicted."

    "Nonsense," said Anthor, acidly. "What makes you so triumphant, anyway? You talk as though
    we have really won a war, when actually we have won nothing but a petty brawl which has
    served only to distract our minds from the real enemy."

    There was an uncomfortable silence, in which only Homir Munn's slight smile struck a



    discordant note.


    And Anthor struck the arm of his chair with a balled and furyfilled fist, "Yes, I refer to the
    Second Foundation. There is no mention of it and, if I judge correctly, every effort to have no
    thought of it. Is it because this fallacious atmosphere of victory that palls over this world of idiots
    is so attractive that you feel you must participate? Turn somersaults then, handspring your way
    into a wall, pound one another's back and throw confetti out the window. Do whatever you
    please, only get it out of your system - and when you are quite done and you are yourselves
    again, return and let us discuss that problem which exists now precisely as it did ten months
    ago when you sat here with eyes cocked over your shoulders for fear of you knew not what. Do
    you really think that the Mind-masters of the Second Foundation are less to be feared because
    you have beat down a foolish wielder of spaceships."

    Fie paused, red-faced and panting.

    Munn said quietly, "Will you hear me speak now, Anthor? Or do you prefer to continue your role
    as ranting conspirator?"

    "Flave your say, Flomir," said Darell, "but let's all of us refrain from over-picturesqueness of
    language. It's a very good thing in its place, but at present, it bores me."

    Flomir Munn leaned back in his armchair and carefully refilled his glass from the decanter at his
    elbow.

    "I was sent to Kalgan," he said, "to find out what I could from the records contained in the
    Mule's Palace. I spent several months doing so. I seek no credit for that accomplishment. As I
    have indicated, it was Arcadia whose ingenuous intermeddling obtained the entry for me.
    Nevertheless, the fact remains that to my original knowledge of the Mule's life and times, which,
    I submit, was not small, I have added the fruits of much labor among primary evidence which
    has been available to no one else.

    "I am, therefore, in a unique position to estimate the true danger of the Second Foundation;
    much more so than is our excitable friend here."

    "And," grated Anthor, "what is your estimate of that danger?"

    "Why, zero."

    A short pause, and Elvett Semic asked with an air of surprised disbelief, "You mean zero
    danger?"

    "Certainly. Friends, there is no Second Foundation!"

    Anthor's eyelids closed slowly and he sat there, face pale and expressionless.

    Munn continued, attention-centering and loving it, "And what is more, there was never one."

    "On what," asked Darell, "do you base this surprising conclusion?"

    "I deny," said Munn, "that it is surprising. You all know the story of the Mule's search for the
    Second Foundation. But what do you know of the intensity of that search - of the



    single-mindedness of it. He had tremendous resources at his disposal and he spared none of it.
    He was single-minded - and yet he failed. No Second Foundation was found."

    "One could scarcely expect it to be found," pointed out Turbor, restlessly. "It had means of
    protecting itself against inquiring minds."

    "Even when the mind that is inquiring is the Mule's mutant mentality? I think not. But come, you
    do not expect me to give you the gist of fifty volumes of reports in five minutes. All of it, by the
    terms of the peace treaty will be part of the Seldon Historical Museum eventually, and you will
    all be free to be as leisurely in your analysis as I have been. You will find his conclusion plainly
    stated, however, and that I have already expressed. There is not, and has never been, any
    Second Foundation."

    Semic interposed, "Well, what stopped the Mule, then?"

    "Great Galaxy, what do you suppose stopped him? Death did; as it will stop all of us. The
    greatest superstition of the age is that the Mule was somehow stopped in an all-conquering
    career by some mysterious entities superior even to himself. It is the result of looking at
    everything in wrong focus.

    "Certainly no one in the Galaxy can help knowing that the Mule was a freak, physical as well as
    mental. He died in his thirties because his ill-adjusted body could no longer struggle its creaking
    machinery along. For several years before his death he was an invalid. His best health was
    never more than an ordinary man's feebleness. All right, then. He conquered the Galaxy and, in
    the ordinary course of nature, proceeded to die. It's a wonder he proceeded as long and as well
    as he did. Friends, it's down in the very clearest print. You have only to have patience. You
    have only to try to look at all facts in new focus."

    Darell said, thoughtfully, "Good, let us try that Munn. It would be an interesting attempt and, if
    nothing else, would help oil our thoughts. These tampered men - the records of which Anthor
    brought to us nearly a year ago, what of them? Help us to see them in focus."

    "Easily. How old a science is encephalographic analysis? Or, put it another way, how
    well-developed is the study of neuronic pathways."

    "We are at the beginning in this respect. Granted," said Darell.

    "Right. How certain can we be then as to the interpretation of what I've heard Anthor and
    yourself call the Tamper Plateau. You have your theories, but how certain can you be. Certain
    enough to consider it a firm basis for the existence of a mighty force for which all other
    evidence is negative? It's always easy to explain the unknown by postulating a superhuman
    and arbitrary will.

    "It's a very human phenomenon. There have been cases all through Galactic history where
    isolated planetary systems have reverted to savagery, and what have we learned there? In
    every case, such savages attribute the to-them-incomprehensible forces of Nature - storms,
    pestilences, droughts - to sentient beings more powerful and more arbitrary than men.

    "It is called anthropomorphism, I believe, and in this respect, we are savages and indulge in it.
    Knowing little of mental science, we blame anything we don't know on supermen - those of the



    Second Foundation in this case, based on the hint thrown us by Seldon."

    "Oh," broke in Anthor, "then you do remember Seldon. I thought you had forgotten. Seldon did
    say there was a Second Foundation. Get that in focus.

    "And are you aware then of all Seldon's purposes. Do you know what necessities were involved
    in his calculations? The Second Foundation may have been a very necessary scarecrow, with
    a highly specific end in view. Flow did we defeat Kalgan, for instance? What were you saying in
    your last series of articles, Turbor?"

    Turbor stirred his bulk. "Yes, I see what "You're driving at. I was on Kalgan towards the end,
    Darell, and it was quite obvious that morale on the planet was incredibly bad. I looked through
    their news-records and - well, they expected to be beaten. Actually, they were completely
    unmanned by the thought that eventually the Second Foundation would take a hand, on the
    side of the First, naturally."

    "Quite right," said Munn. "I was there all through the war. I told Stettin there was no Second
    Foundation and he believed me. He felt safe. But there was no way of making the people
    suddenly disbelieve what they had believed all their lives, so that the myth eventually served a
    very useful purpose in Seldon's cosmic chess game."

    But Anthor's eyes opened, quite suddenly, and fixed themselves sardonically on Munn's
    countenance. "I say you lie. "

    Flomir turned pale, "I don't see that I have to accept, much less answer, an accusation of that
    nature."

    "I say it without any intention of personal offense. You cannot help lying; you don't realize that
    you are. But you lie just the same."

    Semic laid his withered hand on the young man's sleeve. "Take a breath, young fella."

    Anthor shook him off, none too gently, and said, "I'm out of patience with all of you. I haven't
    seen this man more than half a dozen times in my life, yet I find the change in him
    unbelievable. The rest of you have known him for years, yet pass it by. It is enough to drive one
    mad. Do you call this man you've been listening to Flomir Munn? Fie is not the Flomir Munn /
    knew."

    A medley of shock; above which Munn's voice cried, "You claim me to be an impostor?"

    "Perhaps not in the ordinary sense," shouted Anthor above the din, "but an impostor
    nonetheless. Quiet, everyone! I demand to be heard."

    Fie frowned them ferociously into obedience. "Do any of you remember Flomir Munn as I do -
    the introverted librarian who never talked without obvious embarrassment; the man of tense
    and nervous voice, who stuttered out his uncertain sentences? Does this man sound like him?
    Fle's fluent, he's confident, he's fun of theories, and, by Space, he doesn't stutter. Is he the
    same person?"


    Even Munn looked confused, and Pelleas Anthor drove on. "Well, shall we test him?



    How?" asked Darell.


    "You ask how? There is the obvious way. You have his encephalographic record of ten months
    ago, haven't you? Run one again, and compare."

    He pointed at the frowning librarian, and said violently, "I dare him to refuse to subject himself
    to analysis."

    "I don't object," said Munn, defiantly. "I am the man I always was."

    "Can you know?" said Anthor with contempt. "I’ll go further. I trust no one here. I want everyone
    to undergo analysis. There has been a war. Munn has been on Kalgan; Turbor has been on
    board ship and all over the war areas. Darell and Semic have been absent, too - I have no idea
    where. Only I have remained here in seclusion and safety, and I no longer trust any of the rest
    of you. And to play fair, I’ll submit to testing as well. Are we agreed then? Or do I leave now and
    go my own way?"

    Turbor shrugged and said, "I have no objection."

    "I have already said I don't," said Munn.

    Semic moved a hand in silent assent, and Anthor waited for Darell. Finally, Darell nodded his
    head.

    "Take me first," said Anthor.

    The needles traced their delicate way across the cross-hatchings as the young neurologist sat
    frozen in the reclining seat, with lidded eyes brooding heavily. From the files, Darell removed
    the folder containing Anthor's old encephalographic record. He showed them to Anthor.

    "That's your own signature, isn't it?"

    "Yes, yes. It's my record. Make the comparison."

    The scanner threw old and new on to the screen. All six curves in each recording were there,
    and in the darkness, Munn's voice sounded in harsh clarity. "Well, now, look there. There's a
    change."

    "Those are the primary waves of the frontal lobe. It doesn't mean a thing, Homir. Those
    additional jags you're pointing to are just anger. It's the others that count."

    He touched a control knob and the six pairs melted into one another and coincided. The deeper
    amplitude of primaries alone introduced doubling.

    "Satisfied?" asked Anthor.

    Darell nodded curtly and took the seat himself. Semic followed him and Turbor followed him.
    Silently the curves were collected; silently they were compared.

    Munn was the last to take his seat. For a moment, he hesitated, then, with a touch of
    desperation in his voice, he said, "Well now, look, I'm coming in last and I'm under tension. I
    expect due allowance to be made for that."



    "There will be," Darell assured him. "No conscious emotion of yours will affect more than the
    primaries and they are not important."

    It might have been hours, in the utter silence that followed

    And then in the darkness of the comparison, Anthor said huskily: "Sure, sure, it's only the onset
    of a complex. Isn't that what he told us? No such thing as tampering; it's all a silly
    anthropomorphic notion - but look at it! A coincidence I suppose."

    "What's the matter?" shrieked Munn.

    Darell's hand was tight on the librarian's shoulder. "Quiet, Munn - you've been handled; you've
    been adjusted by them."

    Then the light went on, and Munn was looking about him with broken eyes, making a horrible
    attempt to smile.

    "You can't be serious, surely. There is a purpose to this. You're testing me."

    But Darell only shook his head. "No, no, Homir. It's true."

    The librarian's eyes were filled with tears, suddenly. "I don't feel any different. I can't believe it."
    With sudden conviction: "You are all in this. It's a conspiracy."

    Darell attempted a soothing gesture, and his hand was struck aside. Munn snarled, "You're
    planning to kill me. By Space, you're planning to kill me."

    With a lunge, Anthor was upon him. There was the sharp crack of bone against bone, and
    Homir was limp and flaccid with that look of fear frozen on his face.

    Anthor rose shakily, and said, "We'd better tie and gag him. Later, we can decide what to do."
    He brushed his long hair back.

    Turbor said, "How did you guess there was something wrong with him?"

    Anthor turned sardonically upon him. "It wasn't difficult. You see, / happen to know where the
    Second Foundation really is. "

    Successive shocks have a decreasing effect-

    It was with actual mildness that Semic asked, "Are you sure? I mean we’ve just gone through
    this sort of business with Munn-"

    This isn't quite the same," returned Anthor. "Darell, the day the war started, I spoke to you most
    seriously. I tried to have you leave Terminus. I would have told you then what I will tell you now,
    if I had been able to trust you."

    "You mean you have known the answer for half a year?" smiled Darell.

    "I have known it from the time I learned that Arcadia had left for Trantor."

    And Darell started to his feet in sudden consternation. "What had Arcadia to do with it? What



    are you implying?"

    "Absolutely nothing that is not plain on the face of all the events we know so well. Arcadia goes
    to Kalgan and flees in terror to the very center of the Galaxy, rather than return home.
    Lieutenant Dirige, our best agent on Kalgan is tampered with. Homir Munn goes to Kalgan and
    he is tampered with. The Mule conquered the Galaxy, but, queerly enough, he made Kalgan his
    headquarters, and it occurs to me to wonder if he was conqueror or, perhaps, tool. At every
    turn, we meet with Kalgan, Kalgan - nothing but Kalgan, the world that somehow survived
    untouched all the struggles of the warlords for over a century."

    "Your conclusion, then."

    "Is obvious," Anthor's eyes were intense. "The Second Foundation is on Kalgan."

    Turbor interrupted. "I was on Kalgan, Anthor. I was there last week. If there was any Second
    Foundation on it, I'm mad. Personally, I think you're mad."

    The young man whirled on him savagely. "Then you're a fat fool. What do you expect the
    Second Foundation to be? A grammar school? Do you think that Radiant Fields in tight beams
    spell out ‘Second Foundation' in green and purple along the incoming spaceship routes? Listen
    to me, Turbor. Wherever they are, they form a tight oligarchy. They must be as well hidden on
    the world on which they exist, as the world itself is in the Galaxy as a whole."

    Turbor's jaw muscles writhed. "I don't like your attitude, Anthor."

    "That certainly disturbs me," was the sarcastic response. "Take a look about you here on
    Terminus. We’re at the center - the core - the origin of the First Foundation with all its
    knowledge of physical science. Well, how many of the population are physical scientists? Can
    you operate an Energy Transmitting Station? What do you know of the operation of a
    hyperatomic motor? Eh? The number of real scientists on Terminus - even on Terminus - can
    be numbered at less than one percent of the population.

    "And what then of the Second Foundation where secrecy must be preserved. There will still be
    less of the cognoscenti, and these will be hidden even from their own world."

    "Say," said Semic, carefully. "We just licked Kalgan-"

    "So we did. So we did," said Anthor, sardonically. "Oh, we celebrate that victory. The cities are
    still illuminated; they are still shooting off fireworks; they are still shouting over the televisors.

    But now, now, when the search is on once more for the Second Foundation, where is the last
    place well look; where is the last place anyone will look? Right!" Kalgan!

    "We haven't hurt them, you know; not really. We've destroyed some ships, killed a few
    thousands, torn away their Empire, taken over some of their commercial and economic power -
    but that all means nothing. I'll wager that not one member of the real ruling class of Kalgan is in
    the least discomfited. On the contrary, they are now safe from curiosity. But not from my
    curiosity. What do you say, Darell?"

    Darell shrugged his shoulders. "Interesting. I’m trying to fit it in with a message I received from
    Arcadia a few months since."



    "Oh, a message?" asked Anthor. "And what was it?"

    "Well, I'm not certain. Five short words. But its interesting."

    "Look," broke in Semic, with a worried interest, "there's something / don't understand."

    "What's that?"

    Semic chose his words carefully, his old upper lip lifting with each word as if to let them out
    singly and reluctantly. "Well, now, Homir Munn was saying just a while ago that Hari Seldon
    was faking when he said that he had established a Second Foundation. Now you're saying that
    it's not so; that Seldon wasn't faking, eh?"

    "Right, he wasn't faking. Seldon said he had established a Second Foundation and so he had."

    "All right, then, but he said something else, too. Fie said he established the two Foundations at
    opposite ends of the Galaxy. Now, young man, was that a. fake - because Kalgan isn't at the
    opposite end of the Galaxy."

    Anthor seemed annoyed, "That's a minor point. That part may well have been a cover up to
    protect them. But after all, think- What real use would it serve to have the Mind-masters at the
    opposite end of the Galaxy? What is their function? To help preserve the Plan. Who are the
    main card players of the Plan? We, the First Foundation. Where can they best observe us,
    then, and serve their own ends? At the opposite end of the Galaxy? Ridiculous! They're within
    fifty parsecs, actually, which is much more sensible."

    "I like that argument," said Darell. "It makes sense. Look here, Munn's been conscious for some
    time and I propose we loose him. Fie can't do any harm, really."

    Anthor looked rebellious, but Flomir was nodding vigorously. Five seconds later he was rubbing
    his wrists just as vigorously.

    "Flow do you feel?" asked Darell.

    "Rotten," said Munn, sulkily, "but never mind. There's something I want to ask this bright young
    thing here. I've heard what he's had to say, and I’d just like permission to wonder what we do
    next."

    There was a queer and incongruous silence.

    Munn smiled bitterly. "Well, suppose Kalgan is the Second Foundation. Who on Kalgan are
    they? Flow are you going to find them? Flow are you going to tackle them if you find them, eh?"

    "Ah," said Darell, "I can answer that, strangely enough. Shall I tell you what Semic and I have
    been doing this past half-year? It may give you another reason, Anthor, why I was anxious to
    remain on Terminus all this time."

    "In the first place," he went on, "I've been working on encephalographic analysis with more
    purpose than any of you may suspect. Detecting Second Foundation minds is a little more
    subtle than simply finding a Tamper Plateau - and I did not actually succeed. But I came close
    enough.



    "Do you know, any of you, how emotional control works? It's been a popular subject with fiction
    writers since the time of the Mule and much nonsense has been written, spoken, and recorded
    about it. For the most part, it has been treated as something mysterious and occult. Of course,
    it isn't. That the brain is the source of a myriad, tiny electromagnetic fields, everyone knows.
    Every fleeting emotion varies those fields in more or less intricate fashion, and everyone should
    know that, too.

    "Now it is possible to conceive a mind which can sense these changing fields and even
    resonate with them. That is, a special organ of the cerebrum can exist which can take on
    whatever field-pattern it may detect. Exactly how it would do this, I have no idea, but that
    doesn't matter, if I were blind, for instance, I could still learn the significance of photons and
    energy quanta and it could be reasonable to me that the absorption of a photon of such energy
    could create chemical changes in some organ of the body such that its presence would be
    detectable. But, of course, I would not be able, thereby, to understand color.

    "Do all of you follow?"

    There was a firm nod from Anthor; a doubtful nod from the others.

    "Such a hypothetical Mind Resonating Organ, by adjusting itself to the Fields emitted by other
    minds could perform what is popularly known as 'reading emotion’ or even 'reading minds,’
    which is actually something even more subtle. It is but an easy step from that to imagining a
    similar organ which could actually force an adjustment on another mind. It could orient with its
    stronger Field the weaker one of another mind - much as a strong magnet will orient the atomic
    dipoles in a bar of steel and leave it magnetized thereafter.

    "I solved the mathematics of Second Foundationism in the sense that I evolved a function that
    would predict the necessary combination of neuronic paths that would allow for the formation of
    an organ such as I have just described - but, unfortunately, the function is too complicated to
    solve by any of the mathematical tools at present known. That is too bad, because it means
    that I can never detect a Mind-worker by his encephalographic pattern alone.

    "But I could do something else. I could, with Semic's help, construct what I shall describe as a
    Mental Static device. It is not beyond the ability of modem science to create an energy source
    that will duplicate an encephalograph-type pattern of electromagnetic field. Moreover, it can be
    made to shift at complete random, creating, as far as this particular mind-sense is concerned, a
    sort of 'noise' or 'static' which masks other minds with which it may be in contact.

    "Do you still follow?"

    Semic chuckled. Fie had helped create blindly, but he had guessed, and guessed correctly. The
    old man had a trick or two left—

    Anthor said, "I think I do."

    "The device," continued Darell, "is a fairly easy one to produce, and I had all the resources of
    the Foundation under my control as it came under the heading of war research. And now the
    mayor's offices and the Legislative assemblies are surrounded with Mental Static. So are most
    of our key factories. So is this building. Eventually, any place we wish can be made absolutely



    safe from the Second Foundation or from any future Mule. And that's it."

    He ended quite simply with a flat-palmed gesture of the hand.

    Turbor seemed stunned. "Then it's all over. Great Seldon, it's all over."

    "Well," said Darell, "not exactly."

    "How, not exactly? Is there something more?"

    "Yes, we haven't located the Second Foundation yet!"

    "What," roared Anthor, "are you trying to say-"

    "Yes, I am. Kalgan is not the Second Foundation."

    "How do you know?"

    "It's easy," grunted Darell. "You see / happen to know where the Second Foundation really is. "

    21

    The Answer That Satisfied

    Turbor laughed suddenly - laughed in huge, windy gusts that bounced ringingly off the walls
    and died in gasps. He shook his head, weakly, and said, "Great Galaxy, this goes on all night.
    One after another, we put up our straw men to be knocked down. We have fun, but we don't get
    anywhere. Space! Maybe all planets are the Second Foundation. Maybe they have no planet,
    just key men spread on all the planets. And what does it matter, since Darell says we have the
    perfect defense?"

    Darell smiled without humor. "The perfect defense is not enough, Turbor. Even my Mental
    Static device is only something that keeps us in the same place. We cannot remain forever with
    our fists doubled, frantically staring in all directions for the unknown enemy. We must know not
    only how to win, but whom to defeat. And there is a specific world on which the enemy exists."

    "Get to the point," said Anthor, wearily. "What's your information?"

    "Arcadia," said Darell, "sent me a message, and until I got it, I never saw the obvious. I
    probably would never have seen the obvious. Yet it was a simple message that went: 'A circle
    has no end.’ Do you see?"

    "No," said Anthor, stubbornly, and he spoke, quite obviously, for the others.

    "A circle has no end," repeated Munn, thoughtfully, and his forehead furrowed.

    "Well," said Darell, impatiently, "it was clear to me- What is the one absolute fact we know
    about the Second Foundation, eh? I'll tell you! We know that Hari Seldon located it at the
    opposite end of the Galaxy. Homir Munn theorized that Seldon lied about the existence of the
    Foundation. Pelleas Anthor theorized that Seldon had told the truth that far, but lied about the



    location of the Foundation. But I tell you that Hari Seldon lied in no particular; that he told the
    absolute truth.


    "But, what is the other end? The Galaxy is a flat, lens-shaped object. A cross section along the
    flatness of it is a circle, and a circle had no end - as Arcadia realized. We - we, the First
    Foundation - are located on Terminus at the rim of that circle. We are at an end of the Galaxy,
    by definition. Now follow the rim of that circle and find the other end. Follow it, follow it, follow it,
    and you will find no other end. You will merely come back to your starting point-

    "And there you will find the Second Foundation."

    "There?" repeated Anthor. "Do you mean here?"

    "Yes, I mean here!" cried Darell, energetically. "Why, where else could it possibly be? You said
    yourself that if the Second Foundationers were the guardians of the Seldon Plan, it was unlikely
    that they could be located at the so-called other end of the Galaxy, where they would be as
    isolated as they could conceivably be. You thought that fifty parsecs distance was more
    sensible. I tell you that that is also too far. That no distance at all is more sensible. And where
    would they be safest? Who would look for them here? Oh, it's the old principle of the most
    obvious place being the least suspicious.

    "Why was poor Ebling Mis so surprised and unmanned by his discovery of the location of the
    Second Foundation? There he was, looking for it desperately in order to warn it of the coming
    of the Mule, only to find that the Mule had already captured both Foundations at a stroke. And
    why did the Mule himself fail, in his search? Why not? If one is searching for an unconquerable
    menace, one would scarcely look among the enemies already conquered. So the
    Mind-masters, in their own leisurely time, could lay their plans to stop the Mule, and succeeded
    in stopping him.

    "Oh, it is maddeningly simple. For here we are with our plots and our schemes, thinking that we
    are keeping our secrecy - when all the time we are in the very heart and core of our enemy's
    stronghold. It's humorous."

    Anthor did not remove the skepticism from his face, "You honestly believe this theory, Dr.
    Darell?"

    "I honestly believe it."

    "Then any of our neighbors, any man we pass in the street might be a Second Foundation
    superman, with his mind watching yours and feeling the pulse of its thoughts."

    "Exactly."

    "And we have been permitted to proceed all this time, without molestation?"

    "Without molestation? Who told you we were not molested? You, yourself, showed that Munn
    has been tampered with. What makes you think that we sent him to Kalgan in the first place
    entirely of our own volition - or that Arcadia overheard us and followed him on her own volition?
    Hah ! We have been molested without pause, probably. And after all, why should they do more
    than they have? It is far more to their benefit to mislead us, than merely to stop us."



    Anthor buried himself in meditation and emerged therefrom with a dissatisfied expression.

    "Well, then, I don't like it. Your Mental Static isn't worth a thought. We can't stay in the house
    forever and as soon as we leave, we're lost, with what we now think we know. Unless you can
    build a little machine for every inhabitant in the Galaxy."

    "Yes, but we're not quite helpless, Anthor. These men of the Second Foundation have a special
    sense which we lack. It is their strength and also their weakness. For instance, is there any
    weapon of attack that will be effective against a normal, sighted man which is useless against a
    blind man?"

    "Sure," said Munn, promptly. "A light in the eyes."

    "Exactly," said Darell. "A good, strong blinding light."

    "Well, what of it?" asked Turbor.

    "But the analogy is clear. I have a Mind Static device. It sets up an artificial electromagnetic
    pattern, which to the mind of a man of the Second Foundation would be like a beam of light to
    us. But the Mind Static device is kaleidoscopic. It shifts quickly and continuously, faster than the
    receiving mind can follow. All right then, consider it a flickering light; the kind that would give
    you a headache, if continued long enough. Now intensify that light or that electromagnetic field
    until it is blinding - and it will become a pain, an unendurable pain. But only to those with the
    proper sense; not to the unsensed."

    "Really?" said Anthor, with the beginnings of enthusiasm. "Flave you tried this?"

    "On whom? Of course, I haven't tried it. But it will work."

    "Well, where do you have the controls for the Field that surrounds the house? Id like to see this
    thing."

    "Flere." Darell reached into his jacket pocket. It was a small thing, scarcely bulging his pocket.
    Fie tossed the black, knob-studded cylinder to the other.

    Anthor inspected it carefully and shrugged his shoulders. "It doesn't make me any smarter to
    look at it. Look Darell, what mustn't I touch? I don't want to turn off the house defense by
    accident, you know."

    "You won't," said Darell, indifferently. "That control is locked in place." Fie flicked at a toggle
    switch that didn't move.

    "And what's this knob?"

    "That one varies rate of shift of pattern. Flere - this one varies the intensity. It's that which I've
    been referring to."

    "May I-" asked Anthor, with his finger on the intensity knob. The others were crowding close.
    "Why not?" shrugged Darell. "It won't affect us."

    Slowly, almost wincingly, Anthor turned the knob, first in one direction, then in another. Turbor



    was gritting his teeth, while Munn blinked his eyes rapidly. It was as though they were keening
    their inadequate sensory equipment to locate this impulse which could not affect them.

    Finally, Anthor shrugged and tossed the control box back into Darell's lap. "Well, I suppose we
    can take your word for it. But it's certainly hard to imagine that anything was happening when I
    turned the knob."

    "But naturally, Pelleas Anthor," said Darell, with a tight smile. "The one I gave you was a
    dummy. You see I have another." He tossed his jacket aside and seized a duplicate of the
    control box that Anthor had been investigating, which swung from his belt.

    "You see," said Darell, and in one gesture turned the intensity knob to maximum.

    And with an unearthly shriek, Pelleas Anthor sank to the floor. He rolled in his agony; whitened,
    gripping fingers clutching and tearing futilely at his hair.

    Munn lifted his feet hastily to prevent contact with the squirming body, and his eyes were twin
    depths of horror. Semic and Turbor were a pair of plaster casts; stiff and white.

    Darell, somber, turned the knob back once more. And Anthor twitched feebly once or twice and
    lay still. He was alive, his breath racking his body.

    "Lift him on to the couch," said Darell, grasping the young man's head. "Help me here."

    Turbor reached for the feet. They might have been lifting a sack of flour. Then, after long
    minutes, the breathing grew quieter, and Anthor's eyelids fluttered and lifted. His face was a
    horrid yellow; his hair and body was soaked in perspiration, and his voice, when he spoke, was
    cracked and unrecognizable.

    "Don't," he muttered, "don't! Don't do that again! You don't know- You don't know- Oh-h-h." It
    was a long, trembling moan.

    "We won't do it again," said Darell, "if you will tell us the truth. You are a member of the Second
    Foundation?"

    "Let me have some water," pleaded Anthor.

    "Get some, Turbor," said Darell, "and bring the whiskey bottle."

    He repeated the question after pouring a jigger of whiskey and two glasses of water into
    Anthor. Something seemed to relax in the young man-

    "Yes," he said, wearily. "I am a member of the Second Foundation."

    "Which," continued Darell, "is located on Terminus - here?"

    "Yes, yes. You are right in every particular, Dr. Darell."

    "Good! Now explain what's been happening this past half year. Tell us!"

    "I would like to sleep," whispered Anthor.

    "Later! Speak now!"



    A tremulous sigh. Then words, low and hurried. The others bent over him to catch the sound,
    "The situation was growing dangerous. We knew that Terminus and its physical scientists were
    becoming interested in brain-wave patterns and that the times were ripe for the development of
    something like the Mind Static device. And there was growing enmity toward the Second
    Foundation. We had to stop it without ruining Seldon's Plan.

    "We ... we tried to control the movement. We tried to join it. It would turn suspicion and efforts
    away from us. We saw to it that Kalgan declared war as a further distraction. That's why I sent
    Munn to Kalgan. Stettin's supposed mistress was one of us. She saw to it that Munn made the
    proper moves-"

    "Callia is-" cried Munn, but Darell waved him silent.

    Anthor continued, unaware of any interruption, "Arcadia followed. We hadn't counted on that -
    can't foresee everything - so Callia maneuvered her to Trantor to prevent interference. That's
    all. Except that we lost."

    "You tried to get me to go to Trantor, didn't you?" asked Darell.

    Anthor nodded, "Had to get you out of the way. The growing triumph in your mind was clear
    enough. You were solving the problems of the Mind Static device."

    "Why didn't you put me under control?"

    "Couldn't ... couldn't. Had my orders. We were working according to a Plan. If I improvised, I
    would have thrown everything off. Plan only predicts probabilities ... you know that ... like
    Seldon's Plan." He was talking in anguished pants, and almost incoherently. His head twisted
    from side to side in a restless fever. "We worked with individuals ... not groups ... very low
    probabilities involved ... lost out. Besides ... if control you ... someone else invent device ... no
    use ... had to control times ... more subtle ... First Speaker's own plan ... don't know all angles
    ... except ... didn't work a-a-a-" He ran down.

    Darell shook him roughly, "You can't sleep yet. How many of you are there?"

    "Huh? Whatjasay ... oh ... not many ... be surprised fifty ... don't need more."

    "All here on Terminus?"

    "Five ... six out in Space ... like Callia ... got to sleep."

    He stirred himself suddenly as though to one giant effort, and his expressions gained in clarity.
    It was a last attempt at self-justification, at moderating his defeat.

    "Almost got you at the end. Would have turned off defenses and seized you. Would have seen
    who was master. But you gave me dummy controls ... suspected me all along-"

    And finally he was asleep.

    Turbor said, in awed tones, "How long did you suspect him, Darell?"

    "Ever since he first came here," was the quiet response. "He came from Kleise, he said. But I



    knew Kleise; and I knew on what terms we parted. He was a fanatic on the subject of the
    Second Foundation and I had deserted him. My own purposes were reasonable, since I
    thought it best and safest to pursue my own notions by myself. But I couldn't tell Kleise that;
    and he wouldn't have listened if I had. To him, I was a coward and a traitor, perhaps even an
    agent of the Second Foundation. He was an unforgiving man and from that time almost to the
    day of his death he had no dealings with me. Then, suddenly, in his last few weeks of life, he
    writes me - as an old friend - to greet his best and most promising pupil as a co-worker and
    begin again the old investigation.

    "It was out of character. How could he possibly do such a thing without being under outside
    influence, and I began to wonder if the only purpose might not be to introduce into my
    confidence a real agent of the Second Foundation. Well, it was so-"

    He sighed and closed his own eyes for a moment.

    Semic put in hesitantly, "What will we do with all of them ... these Second Foundation fellas?"

    "I don't know," said Darell, sadly. "We could exile them, I suppose. There's Zoranel, for
    instance. They can be placed there and the planet saturated with Mind Static. The sexes can
    be separated, or, better still, they can be sterilized - and in fifty years, the Second Foundation
    will be a thing of the past. Or perhaps a quiet death for all of them would be kinder."

    "Do you suppose," said Turbor, "we could learn the use of this sense of theirs. Or are they born
    with it, like the Mule."

    "I don't know. I think it is developed through long training, since there are indications from
    encephalography that the potentialities of it are latent in the human mind. But what do you want
    that sense for? It hasn't helped them."

    He frowned.

    Though he said nothing, his thoughts were shouting.

    It had been too easy - too easy. They had fallen, these invincibles, fallen like book-villains, and
    he didn't like it.

    Galaxy! When can a man know he is not a puppet? How can a man know he is not a puppet?

    Arcadia was coming home, and his thoughts shuddered away from that which he must face in
    the end.

    She was home for a week, then two, and he could not loose the tight check upon those
    thoughts. How could he? She had changed from child to young woman in her absence, by
    some strange alchemy. She was his link to life; his fink to a bittersweet marriage that scarcely
    outlasted his honeymoon.

    And then, late one evening, he said as casually as he could, "Arcadia, what made you decide
    that Terminus contained both Foundations?"


    They had been to the theater; in the best seats with private trimensional viewers for each; her
    dress was new for the occasion, and she was happy.



    She stared at him for a moment, then tossed it off. "Oh, I Don't know, Father. It just came to
    me."

    A layer of ice thickened about Dr. Darell's heart.

    "Think," he said, intensely. "This is important. What made you decide both Foundations were
    on Terminus."

    She frowned slightly. "Well, there was Lady Callia. I knew she was a Second Foundationer.
    Anthor said so, too."

    "But she was on Kalgan," insisted Darell. "What made you decide on Terminus?"

    And now Arcadia waited for several minutes before she answered. What had made her decide?
    What had made her decide?

    She had the horrible sensation of something slipping just beyond her grasp.

    She said, "She knew about things - Lady Callia did - and must have had her information from
    Terminus. Doesn't that sound right, Father?

    But he just shook his head at her.

    "Father," she cried, "I knew. The more I thought, the surer I was. It just made sense."

    There was that lost look in her father's eyes, "It's no good, Arcadia. Its no good. Intuition is
    suspicious when concerned with the Second Foundation. You see that, don't you? It might have
    been intuition - and it might have been control!"

    "Control! You mean they changed me? Oh, no. No, they couldn't." She was backing away from
    him. "But didn't Anthor say I was right? Fie admitted it. He admitted everything. And you've
    found the whole bunch right here on Trantor. Didn't you? Didn't you?" She was breathing
    quickly.

    "I know, but- Arcadia, will you let me make an encephalographic analysis of your brain?'

    She shook her head violently, "No, no! I'm too scared."

    "Of me, Arcadia? There's nothing to be afraid of. But we must know. You see that, don't you?"

    She interrupted him only once, after that. She clutched at his arm just before the last switch
    was thrown. "What if I am different, Father? What will you have to do?"

    "I won't have to do anything, Arcadia. If you're different, well leave. Well go back to Trantor, you
    and I, and ... and we won't care about anything else in the Galaxy."

    Never in Darell's life had an analysis proceeded so slowly, cost him so much, and when it was
    over, Arcadia huddled down and dared not look. Then she heard him laugh and that was
    information enough. She jumped up and threw herself into his opened arms.

    He was babbling wildly as they squeezed one another, "The house is under maximum Mind
    Static and your brain-waves are normal. We really have trapped them, Arcadia, and we can go



    back to living."

    "Father," she gasped, "can we let them give us medals now?"

    "How did you know I’d asked to be left out of it?" He held her at arm's mind; you know
    everything. All right, you can have your medal on a platform, with speeches."

    "And Father?"

    "Yes?"

    "Can you call me Arkady from now on."

    "But- Very well, Arkady."

    Slowly the magnitude of the victory was soaking into him and saturating him. The Foundation -
    the First Foundation - now the only Foundation - was absolute master of the Galaxy. No
    further barrier stood between themselves and the Second Empire - the final fulfillment of
    Seldon's Plan.

    They had only to reach for it-
    Thanks to-


    22

    The Answer That Was True

    An unlocated room on an unlocated world!

    And a man whose plan had worked.

    The First Speaker looked up at the Student, "Fifty men and women," he said. "Fifty martyrs!
    They knew it meant death or permanent imprisonment and they could not even be oriented to
    prevent weakening - since orientation might have been detected. Yet they did not weaken.
    They brought the plan through, because they loved the greater Plan."

    "Might they have been fewer?" asked the Student, doubtfully.

    The First Speaker slowly shook his head, "It was the lower limit. Less could not possibly have
    carried conviction. In fact, pure objectivism would have demanded seventy-five to leave margin
    for error. Never mind. Have you studied the course of action as worked out by the Speakers'
    Council fifteen years ago?"

    "Yes, Speaker."

    "And compared it with actual developments?"

    "Yes, Speaker." Then, after a pause-
    "I was quite amazed, Speaker."



    "I know. There is always amazement. If you knew how many men labored for how many
    months - years, in fact - to bring about the polish of perfection, you would be less amazed.

    Now tell me what happened - in words. I want your translation of the mathematics."

    "Yes, Speaker." The young man marshaled his thoughts. "Essentially, it was necessary for the
    men of the First Foundation to be thoroughly convinced that they had located and destroyed
    the Second Foundation. In that way, there would be reversion to the intended original. To all
    intents, Terminus would once again know nothing about us; include us in none of their
    calculations. We are hidden once more, and safe - at the cost of fifty men."

    "And the purpose of the Kalganian war?"

    "To show the Foundation that they could beat a physical enemy - to wipe out the damage done
    to their self-esteem and self-assuredness by the Mule."

    "There you are insufficient in your analysis. Remember, the population of Terminus regarded us
    with distinct ambivalence. They hated and envied our supposed superiority; yet they relied on
    us implicitly for protection. If we had been 'destroyed' before the Kalganian war, it would have
    meant panic throughout the Foundation. They would then never have had the courage to stand
    up against Stettin, when he then attacked; and he would have. Only in the full flush of victory
    could the 'destruction' have taken place with minimum ill-effects. Even waiting a year,
    thereafter, might have meant a too-great cooling off spirit for success."

    The Student nodded. "I see. Then the course of history will proceed without deviation in the
    direction indicated by the Plan."

    "Unless," pointed out the First Speaker, "further accidents, unforeseen and individual, occur."

    "And for that," said the Student, "we still exist. Except- Except- One facet of the present state
    of affairs worries me, Speaker. The First Foundation is left with the Mind Static device - a
    powerful weapon against us. That, at least, is not as it was before."

    "A good point. But they have no one to use it against. It has become a sterile device; just as
    without the spur of our own menace against them, encephalographic analysis will become a
    sterile science. Other varieties of knowledge will once again bring more important and
    immediate returns. So this first generation of mental scientists among the First Foundation will
    also be the last - and, in a century, Mind Static will be a nearly forgotten item of the past."

    "Well-" The Student was calculating mentally. "I suppose you're right."

    But what I want you most to realize, young man, for the sake of your future in the Council is the
    consideration given to the tiny intermeshings that were forced into our plan of the last decade
    and a half simply because we dealt with individuals. There was the manner in which Anthor had
    to create suspicion against himself in such a way that it would mature at the right time, but that
    was relatively simple.

    "There was the manner in which the atmosphere was so manipulated that to no one on
    Terminus would it occur, prematurely, that Terminus itself might be the center they were
    seeking. That knowledge had to be supplied to the young girl, Arcadia, who would be heeded



    by no one but her own father. She had to be sent to Trantor, thereafter, to make certain that
    there would be no premature contact with her father. Those two were the two poles of a
    hyperatomic motor; each being inactive without the other. And the switch had to be thrown -
    contact had to be made - at just the right moment. I saw to that!

    "And the final battle had to be handled properly. The Foundation's fleet had to be soaked in
    self-confidence, while the fleet of Kalgan made ready to run. I saw to that, also!"

    Said the Student, "It seems to me, Speaker, that you ... I mean, all of us ... were counting on
    Dr. Darell not suspecting that Arcadia was our tool. According to my check on the calculations,
    there was something like a thirty percent probability that he would so suspect. What would have
    happened then?"

    "We had taken care of that. What have you been taught about Tamper Plateaus? What are
    they? Certainly not evidence of the introduction of an emotional bias. That can be done without
    any chance of possible detection by the most refined conceivable encephalographic analysis. A
    consequence of Leffert's Theorem, you know. It is the removal, the cutting-out, of previous
    emotional bias, that shows. It must show.

    "And, of course, Anthor made certain that Darell knew all about Tamper Plateaus.

    "However- When can an individual be placed under Control without showing it? Where there is
    no previous emotional bias to remove. In other words, when the individual is a new-born infant
    with a blank slate of a mind. Arcadia Darell was such an infant here on Trantor fifteen years
    ago, when the first line was drawn into the structure of the plan. She will never know that she
    has been Controlled, and will be all the better for it, since her Control involved the development
    of a precocious and intelligent personality."

    The First Speaker laughed shortly, "In a sense, it is the irony of it all that is most amazing. For
    four hundred years, so many men have been blinded by Seldon's words 'the other end of the
    Galaxy.' They have brought their own peculiar, physical-science thought to the problem,
    measuring off the other end with protractors and rulers, ending up eventually either at a point in
    the periphery one hundred eighty degrees around the rim of the Galaxy, or back at the original
    point.

    "Yet our very greatest danger lay in the fact that there was a possible solution based on
    physical modes of thought. The Galaxy, you know, is not simply a flat ovoid of any sort; nor is
    the periphery a closed curve. Actually, it is a double spiral, with at least eighty percent of the
    inhabited planets on the Main Arm. Terminus is the extreme outer end of the spiral arm, and we
    are at the other - since, what is the opposite end of a spiral? Why, the center.

    "But that is trifling. It is an accidental and irrelevant solution. The solution could have been
    reached immediately, if the questioners had but remembered that Hari Seldon was a social
    scientist not a physical scientist and adjusted their thought processes accordingly. What could
    'opposite ends’ mean to a social scientist? Opposite ends on the map? Of course not. That's
    the mechanical interpretation only.

    "The First Foundation was at the periphery, where the original Empire was weakest, where its
    civilizing influence was least, where its wealth and culture were most nearly absent. And where



    is the social opposite end of the Galaxy? Why, at the place where the original Empire was
    strongest, where its civilizing influence was most, where its wealth and culture were most
    strongly present.

    "Here! At the center! At Trantor, capital of the Empire of Seldon's time.

    "And it is so inevitable. Hari Seldon left the Second Foundation behind him to maintain,
    improve, and extend his work That has been known, or guessed at, for fifty years. But where
    could that best be done? At Trantor, where Seldon's group had worked, and where the data of
    decades had been accumulated. And it was the purpose of the Second Foundation to protect
    the Plan against enemies. That, too, was known! And where was the source of greatest danger
    to Terminus and the Plan?

    "Here! Here at Trantor, where the Empire dying though it was, could, for three centuries, still
    destroy the Foundation, if it could only have decided to do so.

    "Then when Trantor fell and was sacked and utterly destroyed, a short century ago, we were
    naturally able to protect our headquarters, and, on all the planet, the Imperial Library and the
    grounds about it remained untouched. This was well-known to the Galaxy, but even that
    apparently overwhelming hint passed them by.

    "It was here at Trantor that Ebling Mis discovered us; and here that we saw to it that he did not
    survive the discovery. To do so, it was necessary to arrange to have a normal Foundation girl
    defeat the tremendous mutant powers of the Mule. Surely, such a phenomenon might have
    attracted suspicion to the planet on which it happened- It was here that we first studied the
    Mule and planned his ultimate defeat. It was here that Arcadia was born and the train of events
    begun that led to the great return to the Seldon Plan.

    "And all those flaws in our secrecy; those gaping holes; remained unnoticed because Seldon
    had spoken of 'the other end’ in his way, and they had interpreted it in their way."

    The First Speaker had long since stopped speaking to the Student. It was an exposition to
    himself, really, as he stood before the window, looking up at the incredible blaze of the
    firmament, at the huge Galaxy that was now safe forever.

    "Hari Seldon called Trantor, 'Star's End,’" he whispered, "and why not that bit of poetic imagery.
    All the universe was once guided from this rock; all the apron strings of the stars led here. 'All
    roads lead to Trantor,' says the old proverb, 'and that is where all stars end.'"

    Ten months earlier, the First Speaker had viewed those same crowding stars - nowhere as
    crowded as at the center of that huge cluster of matter Man calls the Galaxy - with misgivings;
    but now there was a somber satisfaction on the round and ruddy face of Preem Palver - First
    Speaker.
